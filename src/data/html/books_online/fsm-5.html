        <p><strong>Jesse Wm. Barton</strong></p>
        <p>In 1977, the Oregon Legislature adopted the state’s
        indeterminate (parole matrix) sentencing system. Effective
        November 1, 1989, the legislature replaced that system with the
        Oregon Sentencing Guidelines, a determinate sentencing system.
        The differences between indeterminate and determinate sentencing
        systems are discussed later in this chapter. Under either
        system:</p>

        <p>“(5) ‘Sentence’ means all legal consequences established or
        imposed by the trial court after conviction of an offense,

        removal from office, monetary obligation, probation, conditions

        <p>Although the legislature and the Oregon electorate,
        subsequent to the adoption of the guidelines, approved
        additional felony sentencing systems, these additional systems
        supplement, rather than replace, the guidelines. Consequently,
        this manual primarily focuses on the guidelines.</p>

        then discusses the guidelines’ historical development and the
        manner in which they may be amended. The chapter also provides a
        summary of the categories of crimes and defendants to which the
        guidelines apply. Following that are analyses of the guidelines’
        stated definitions and the various rules used in construing the
        guidelines. Finally, the chapter discusses certain questions
        regarding the guidelines’ constitutionality and trial court

        class="level1">
        <h1>§ 1-1. OAR 213-002-0001 STATEMENT OF PURPOSES AND
        PRINCIPLES.</h1>
        <p>OAR 213-002-0001 states the guidelines’ principles and
        purposes:</p>
        <p>(1) The primary objectives of sentencing are to punish each
        offender appropriately, and to insure the security of the people
        in person and property, within the limits of correctional
        resources provided by the Legislative Assembly, local
        governments and the people.</p>
        <p>(2) Sentencing guidelines are intended to forward the
        objectives described in section (1) by defining presumptive
        punishments for felony convictions, subject to judicial
        discretion to deviate for substantial and compelling reasons;
        and presumptive punishments for post-prison or probation
        supervision violations, again subject to deviation.</p>
        <p>(3) The basic principles which underlie these guidelines
        are:</p>
        <p>(a) The response of the corrections system to crime, and to
        violation of post-prison and probation supervision, must reflect
        the resources available for that response. A corrections system
        that overruns its resources is a system that cannot deliver its
        threatened punishment or its rehabilitative impact. This
        undermines the system’s credibility with the public and the
        offender, and vitiates the objectives of prevention of
        recidivism and reformation of the offender. A corrections system
        that overruns its resources can produce costly litigation and
        the threat of loss of system control to the federal judiciary. A
        corrections system that overruns its resources can increase the
        risk to life and property within the system and to the
        public.</p>
        <p>(b) Oregon’s current sentencing system combines indeterminate
        sentences with a parole matrix. Although many citizens believe
        the indeterminate sentence sets the length of imprisonment, that
        sentence only sets an offender’s maximum period of incarceration
        and the matrix controls actual length of stay. The frequent
        disparity between the indeterminate sentence length and time
        served under the matrix confuses and angers the public and
        damages the corrections system’s credibility with the public.
        Sentences of imprisonment should represent the time an offender
        will actually serve, subject only to any reduction authorized by
        law.</p>
        <p>(c) Under sentencing guidelines the response to many crimes
        will be state imprisonment. Other crimes will be punished by
        local penalties and restrictions imposed as part of probation.
        All offenders released from prison will be under post-prison
        supervision for a period of time. The ability of the corrections
        system to enforce swiftly and sternly the conditions of both
        probation and post-prison supervision, including by
        imprisonment, is crucial. Use of state institutions as the
        initial punishment for crime must, therefore, leave enough
        institutional capacity to permit imprisonment, when appropriate,
        for violation of probation and post-prison supervision
        conditions.</p>
        <p>(d) Subject to the discretion of the sentencing judge to
        deviate and impose a different sentence in recognition of
        aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the appropriate
        punishment for a felony conviction should depend on the
        seriousness of the crime of conviction when compared to all
        other crimes and the offender’s criminal history.</p>
        <p>(e) Subject to the sentencing judge’s discretion to deviate
        in recognition of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the
        corrections system should seek to respond in a consistent way to
        like crimes combined with like criminal histories; and in a
        consistent way to like violations of probation and post-prison
        supervision conditions.</p>
        <section id="intent_of_provision." class="level2">
        <h2><strong>§ 1-1.1. Intent of Provision.</strong></h2>
        <p>The commentary to this provision states: “The purposes of
        sentencing in Oregon and the principles that guide sentencing
        practices to achieve those purposes are legislative issues. This
        provision states the State Sentencing Guidelines Board’s
        understanding of those purposes and principles as provided in
        the guidelines enabling legislation, Chapter 619, Oregon Laws
        1987 (1987 legislation).” Sentencing Guidelines Implementation
        Manual 6 (1989) (hereafter Implementation Manual).</p>
        <p>Regardless of what the legislature declared are the purposes
        and principles of sentencing, the Oregon Constitution states its
        own set of principles: “Laws for the punishment of crime shall
        be founded on these principles: protection of society, personal
        responsibility, and accountability for one’s actions and
        reformation.” Or Const, Art I, § 15. <em>See also</em> <a

        criteria [of Article I, section 15] can be applied on the level
        of individualized sentencing, their particular significance must
        vary depending on the circumstances of the crime or crimes being
        sentenced”). It is noteworthy that although “reformation” is a
        constitutionally based sentencing principle, the legislative
        purposes and principles do not mention it. To the extent the
        principles set by legislature conflict with those set by the
        constitution, the constitutional principles control. <em>See,

        <em>PRACTICE TIP:</em>' The terms “reformation” and
        “rehabilitation” are interchangeable. When relying on Article I,
        section 15’s reformation principle, defense counsel should cite
        to Pope Francis’s address to United States Congress. He said, “A

        <p>OAR 213-002-0001(1) reflects what the 1987 Legislature
        identified as the main purpose for sentencing, <em>i.e.</em>,
        “to punish each criminal offender appropriately and insure the

        <h2><strong>§ 1-1.3. Presumptive Punishments.</strong></h2>
        <p>Guidelines’ commentary explains that OAR 213-002-0001(2)</p>
        <p>“states the role of sentencing guidelines to define
        presumptive punishments subject to judicial authority to depart
        for substantial and compelling reasons. The enabling legislation
        directs the creation of guidelines which provide for ‘a sentence
        within the range of sanctions provided by law for the crime or
        crimes involved.’ [Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 2(1).] The 1987
        legislation also provides that the court ‘may impose a sentence
        outside the presumptive sentence or sentence range . . . if it
        finds, considering the purposes of this 1987 Act, there are
        substantial and compelling reasons justifying a deviation from
        the presumptive sentence.’ [ORS 137.671(1)].”</p>
        <p><em>Implementation Manual</em> at 6.</p>
        <p>For felony defendants, the guidelines create “presumptive”
        sentences, <em>i.e.</em>, sentences the law presumes are the
        appropriate sentences in specific cases. <em>See</em> <a

        v. Woodin</a>, 131 Or App 171, 175-76, 883 P2d 1332 (1994)
        (“[u]nder the guidelines, the maximum sentence is the
        presumptive sentence, unless the court finds substantial and
        compelling reasons to impose a departure”).</p>
        <p>OAR 213-003-0001(16) defines the term “presumptive sentence.”
        It states: “‘Presumptive sentence’ means the sentence provided
        in a grid block for an offender classified in that grid block by
        the combined effect of the crime seriousness ranking of the
        current crime of conviction and the offender’s criminal history
        or a sentence designated as a presumptive sentence by statute.”
        <em>Id</em>. Thus, presumptive sentences generally are found in
        the guidelines grid, but sometimes are found in special
        statutes. Chapter 4 discusses statutes that designate
        “presumptive” sentences found outside the grid.</p>
        <p>In exceptional cases, the guidelines allow the sentencing
        court to depart (deviate) from the presumptive sentence. ORS
        137.671. Departure sentences are discussed in Chapter 7. The
        sentencing court also may impose non-presumptive sentences in
        cases where supplemental sentencing schemes apply. These schemes
        also are discussed in Chapter 4.</p>

        Bill 5004 (enrolled as Oregon Laws 2021, chapter 468) is the
        2021 Legislature’s primary measure appropriating funds to the
        Department of Corrections (DOC) for the 2021-23 biennium. The
        bill’s Section 1 appropriates from the general fund
        $1,974,379,412. Of that amount, $207,918,693 is for
        administrative-type functions. The Community Corrections
        Division’s portion of the total is $290,147,396, which is about
        14.7% of the total general fund appropriation. Assuming 14.7% of

        Corrections portion, the total cost for Community Corrections is
        $290,147,396 + ($207,918,693 x 14.7%) = $320,605,604. That
        leaves a total of $1,626,773,808 of the DOC’s general fund
        appropriation for imprisonment.</p>
        <p>Section 2 of HB 5004 specifies a non-general fund
        appropriation of $78,516,562. Of that amount, $53,240,720 is for

        Division’s portion of the total is $6,441,863, which is about
        8.2% of the total non-general fund appropriation. Assuming 8.2%

        for imprisonment.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, the combined general and non-general fund
        appropriations for imprisonment, for the 2021-23 biennium, is:

        States v. Craig</a>, 703 F3d 1001 (7th Cir 2012) (Posner, J.,

        well-worn theory that increasing the length of incarceration
        incapacitates the defendant longer. Because this limits his
        ability to commit more crimes, the theory goes, lengthier

        <p>The economy principle assumed even greater significance in
        2003 when the legislature passed Senate Bill 267 (enrolled as
        2003 Oregon Laws, chapter 669; partially codified at ORS 182.515
        and 182.525). SB 267 now requires that various state agencies,
        including the DOC, the Oregon Youth Authority, and the Criminal
        Justice Commission, spend “at least 75 percent of state moneys”
        the agencies receive on “evidence-based programs.” ORS
        182.525(1).</p>
        <p>The statutory scheme defines “program” as</p>
        <p>“a treatment or intervention program or service that is
        intended to:</p>
        <p>“(A) Reduce the propensity of a person to commit crimes;</p>
        <p>“(B) Improve the mental health of a person with the result of
        reducing the likelihood that the person will commit a
        crime[.]”</p>
        <p>ORS 182.515(4)(a).</p>
        <p>Article I, section 15, of the Oregon Constitution mandates
        that “[l]aws for the punishment of crime shall be founded on
        four principles[.]” These principles include “reformation,”
        <em>id.</em>, which pertains to reducing the propensity, or the
        likelihood, that a person will commit crimes. Imprisonment seeks
        to serve the reformation principle. <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12498319768823710840&amp;q=291+Or+153&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">State

        generally</em> Arthur W. Campbell, <em>Law of Sentencing</em> §
        2:4 (3d ed. 2004) (hereafter Campbell).</p>
        <p>Therefore, under ORS 182.515(4)(a)’s definition, imprisonment
        is a “program.” To ensure that the DOC meets its evidence-based
        program statutory mandate, a Court should impose a “program” of
        an extended term of imprisonment, only if that extended term is
        “evidence-based.”</p>
        <p>An “[e]vidence-based program” is</p>
        <p>“a program that:</p>
        <p>“(a) Incorporates significant and relevant practices based on
        scientifically based re search; and</p>
        <p>“(b) Is cost-effective.”</p>
        <p>ORS 182.515(3).</p>
        <p>ORS 182.515(5) defines the first part of the “evidence-based
        program” definition:</p>
        <p>“‘Scientifically based research’ means research that obtains
        reliable and valid knowledge by:</p>
        <p>“(a) Employing systematic, empirical methods that draw on
        observation or experiment;</p>
        <p>“(b) Involving rigorous data analyses that are adequate to
        test the stated hypotheses and justify the general conclusions
        drawn;</p>
        <p>“(c) Relying on measurements or observational methods that
        provide reliable and valid data across evaluators and observers,
        across multiple measurements and observations and across studies
        by the same or different investigators; and</p>
        <p>“(d) Utilizing randomized controlled trials when possible and
        appropriate.”</p>
        <p>(Emphasis added.)</p>
        <p>ORS 182.515(2) defines the second part of the “evidence-based
        program” definition: “Cost-effective” means that “cost savings
        realized over a reasonable period of time are greater than [its]
        costs.”</p>
        <p>Scientifically based research, in the form of sociological
        studies, demonstrates that a “program” of extended incarceration
        is not “evidence-based.” This is because such a program is as
        likely to increase persons’ propensity to commit crimes as it is
        to reduce it. This scientifically based research further shows
        that extended incarceration can have the effect of degenerating
        persons’ mental health, thereby increasing their likelihood of
        committing crimes. Because a program of extended incarceration
        has the likelihood of increasing persons’ propensity to commit
        crimes, including by worsening their mental health, a program of
        extended incarceration cannot be “cost-effective.”</p>
        <p>Consider the meta-analysis of David Roodman, <em>The Impacts
        of Incarceration on Crime</em> at 7, Open Philanthropy Project,
        Sept 2017. He explains:</p>
        <p>“[T]he question of the net impact of incarceration on crime
        must be brought to the data. Having reviewed and revisited
        published analyses in unprecedented depth, my best estimate is
        that the best estimate of the impact of additional incarceration
        on crime in the United States today is zero. And, while that
        estimate is not certain, there is as much reason overall to
        believe that <span class="underline">incarceration increases
        crime as decreases it</span>.”</p>
        <p>(Boldface in original; underscore added.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Oliver Roeder, <em>et al.</em>, <em>What Caused the Crime
        Decline?</em>, Brennan Center for Justice (2015) concur. They
        agree that lengthy prison sentences are as likely to fail as
        they are to succeed in reducing crime rates:</p>
        <p>“In 2006, sociologist Bruce Western examined how
        incarceration influenced crime through rehabilitation,
        incapacitation, and deterrence. Using data through 2000, Western
        estimated that about 10 percent of the 1990s crime drop could be
        attributed to increased incarceration. To isolate the effects of
        incarceration, he controlled for other variables, including:
        spending on police, various indicators of unemployment, income
        inequality, racial demographics, sentencing guidelines and
        practices, and political parties in power. Western also made
        adjustments for the effect of prison on crime, which includes
        how prison can actually increase crime (<em>i.e.</em> upon
        release from prison, research shows, many individuals become
        more likely to commit more crime). (This effect is often
        referred to as the “criminogenic” effect of prison. The
        phenomenon of two variables that simultaneously affect one
        another is called a ‘simultaneity effect’ in economic analysis.
        * * *)”</p>
        <p><em>What Caused the Crime Decline?</em> <em>Id</em>. at 20
        (footnotes omitted; emphasis added).</p>
        <p>Roeder, <em>et al</em>. explain the source of this
        criminogenic effect of prison: “Once an individual enters
        prison, they are surrounded by other prisoners who have often
        committed more serious and violent offenses. Upon release, they
        often have trouble finding employment and reintegrating into
        society due to both legal barriers and social stigma.”
        <em>Id</em>. at 25 (footnotes omitted).</p>
        <p>In sum, scientifically based research (sociological studies)
        establishes that a program of extended incarceration is not
        “evidence based.” <em>See also</em> Marc Mauer, <em>The Race to
        Incarcerate</em> 92-112 (2d ed 2006). Defense counsel should
        argue that, to the extent possible, courts should avoid imposing
        sentences that would force the DOC to violate its evidence-based
        program requirements under ORS 182.525(1).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, ORS 182.515’s definition of “scientifically
        based research” tracks with the definition of “scientific”
        evidence that is used in determining whether evidence is
        admissible under OEC 702. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10154162156262782119&amp;q=335+or.+555&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">State
        v. Marrington</a>, 335 Or 555, 73 P3d 911 (2003). Consequently,
        defense counsel may argue that although the evidence code
        generally does not apply in sentencing hearings, OEC 101(4)(d),
        owing to ORS 182.515, OEC 702-type principles do apply and
        regulate the prosecution’s proof.</p>
        <p>PRACTICE TIP: With great regularity, defense counsel
        represent clients at sentencing who suffer from various forms of
        physical and psychological disabilities that are subject to the
        requirements of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act
        (ADA). If these clients are sentenced to prison, the ADA will
        require the DOC to accommodate the clients’ disabilities.

        1952, 141 L Ed 2d 215 (1998). <em>See also</em> <a

        (1994) (deliberate indifference to inmate’s serious medical
        needs may violate Eighth Amendment). Indeed, the client may sue
        the DOC for monetary damages if it fails to accommodate the
        client’s disability. <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5079223862968251341&amp;q=546+us+151&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38">United

        defense counsel, in addition to relying on a general application
        of the economy principle, should consider specifically relying
        on the potential costs to the DOC of accommodation under the ADA
        and the Eighth Amendment, as well as the possibility of DOC
        liability for violating the ADA, to try to persuade the court to
        sentence leniently.</p>

        <h3><strong>§ 1-1.4.2. Veracity Principle (Determinate
        Sentencing).</strong></h3>
        <p>The veracity principle is set out at OAR 213-002-0001(3)(b).
        It is grounded on a “need for a sentencing system which provides
        truth-in-sentencing. Under the guidelines system, the sentence
        imposed will not be shortened by parole. The only term
        reductions permitted under the guidelines system will be those
        expressly provided by statute.” <em>Implementation Manual</em>
        at 7.</p>
        <p>This principle recognizes that the guidelines represented a
        fundamental change in sentencing policies. The former parole
        matrix system is an “indeterminate sentencing” system,
        <em>i.e.</em>, a system in which the sentencing court</p>
        <p>“a minimum and a maximum incarceration term, allowing the
        possibility of release on parole between the expiration of those
        terms; the date and conditions of release before the maximum
        term is generally determined by a board of parole.</p>
        <p>“This statutory system originated in the 19th Century and
        rests upon the rehabilitative rationale. Since the amount of
        time needed to rehabilitate an offender varies with each
        individual and cannot be known precisely at the time of
        sentencing, indeterminate terms give offenders an incentive to
        cooperate in their rehabilitation by promising them freedom when
        sufficiently improved.”</p>
        <p>Campbell, § 4:2, p 105 (footnotes omitted).</p>
        <p>During the pre-guidelines era, the Board of Parole and
        Post-Prison Supervision (then, simply called the “Parole Board”)
        could, and regularly did, release defendants long before they
        completed serving their judicially imposed maximum terms. These
        early releases carried a terrific political liability, which
        itself prompted the legislature to adopt the guidelines and to
        finance prison construction.</p>
        <p>Professor Kirkpatrick explains that granting early releases
        “created a public backlash against both the Parole Board and its
        matrix as defendants sentenced to prison soon reappeared in the
        community after serving only a fraction of their prison
        sentences. Thus, these early release programs gave the state
        corrections system the image of being a ‘revolving door.’” Laird

        lengths of stay were, on the average, 24% of the judicial
        sentence imposed”).</p>
        <p>The guidelines system is the converse of the parole matrix
        system. It is a “determinate sentencing” system—one in which the
        court imposes sentences</p>
        <p>“whose length can be measured with relative certainty at the
        time they are imposed. Only credit for time served, good time,
        and work time can reduce the term decreed on sentencing day. * *
        *</p>
        <p>“Although different species abound * * * , there are two
        features common to all determinate sentences. First, the
        sentencing judge imposes a single term (instead of a minimum and
        maximum term as under an indeterminate system). Second, there is
        no subsequent parole-board decision (as with indeterminate
        systems) to release the prisoner earlier than the imposed
        term.”</p>
        <p>Campbell, § 4:3, at 110-11 (footnotes omitted).</p>
        <p>When the legislature adopted the guidelines, it
        simultaneously disabled the Parole Board from paroling
        defendants who receive guidelines sentences. Or Laws 1989, ch
        790, § 28. The only exceptions are for guidelines-era murder
        defendants, <em>see</em> Or Laws 1999, ch 782, § 2 (overturning

        defendants who incurred “dangerous offender” sentences. ORS
        161.725(1). The legislature thereby ensured that subject to
        these two exceptions, the guidelines would be a determinate
        sentencing system. Some appellate decisions accurately recognize
        this fundamental change in sentencing systems. <a

        <h3><strong>§ 1-1.4.5. Selective vs. Collective
        Incapacitation.</strong></h3>
        <p>Mass incarceration is a consequence; specifically, it is a
        consequence of criminal justice system policies and practices.
        These <strong>policies</strong> predominantly include the
        application of “<strong>collective</strong> incapacitation”
        sentencing schemes, as opposed to “<strong>selective</strong>
        incapacitation” schemes.</p>
        <p>“Incapacitation” is perhaps the primary rationale for
        incarcerating criminal defendants. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Arthur W.
        Campbell, <em>Law of Sentencing</em>, § 2:3 (3d ed 2004). The
        rationale is thought to serve the “protection of society,” which
        in Oregon is a foundational principle “for the punishment of
        crime[.]” Or Const, Art I, § 15. That principle also is found in
        the guidelines, whose “primary objectives of sentencing” include
        “insur[ing] the security of the people.” OAR
        213-002-0001(1).</p>
        <p>The incapacitation rationale is grounded on the theory that
        “society need not fear offenders who are rendered physically
        incapable of committing crime.” Campbell, <em>Law of
        Sentencing</em>, § 2:3 at 42. “Few prisoners escape; there are
        few offenses which they can commit inside; and their victims are
        usually their fellow prisoners or custodians.” Nigel Walker,
        <em>Sentencing in a Rational Society</em> 164 (1972), <em>quoted
        in</em> Campbell, § 2:3 at 42. But owing to the “criminogenic
        effect of prison,” Dr. Oliver Roeder, <em>et al.</em>, <em>What
        Caused the Crime Decline?</em> at 20, Brennan Center for Justice
        (2015), in the long run, <strong>extended</strong>
        incapacitation may be as likely to fail, as it is to achieve,
        its desired goal of societal protection.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, there are two, polar-opposite types of
        incapacitation: selective and collective.
        <strong>Selective</strong> incapacitation puts incarceration to
        “the most efficient use,” by “restrict[ing the incapacitation]
        rationale to justifying imprisonment for only the most dangerous
        offenders, and recogniz[ing] the need for more accurate
        presentence studies to diagnose those types.” Campbell, § 2:3 at
        43. “‘Selective incapacitation strategies offer the possibility
        of achieving greater reductions in crime at considerably smaller
        costs in prison resources[.]’” Campbell, § 2:3 at 44 n 13
        (quoting Jacqueline Cohen, <em>Incapacitating Criminals: Recent
        Research Findings</em>, National Institute of Justice (Dec.
        1983)). <em>See also</em> Ben Vollaard, <em>Preventing Crime
        Through Selective Incapacitation</em>, 123 The Economic Journal
        262 (2013).</p>
        <p>For example, consider that an estimated “70 percent of all
        serious criminal offenses are committed by roughly 7 percent of
        offenders, a group commonly referred to as career criminals.”
        David W. Neubauer &amp; Henry F. Fradella, <em>America’s Courts
        &amp; the Criminal Justice System</em> 223 (11th ed 2014)
        (citing Matthew G. Vaughn &amp; Matt DeLisi, <em>Were Wolfgang’s
        Chronic Offenders Psychopaths: On the Convergent Validity
        Between Psychopathy &amp; Career Criminality</em>, 36 Journal of
        Criminal Justice 33-42 (2008) and Matt DeLisi, Career Criminals
        in Society (2005)). Theoretically, a selective-incapacitation
        system that unerringly targets the 7% could reduce the serious
        crime rate by 70%. The cost of incapacitating only that 7% would
        be low, but its crime-rate reductions would be massive. Such a
        system would be so efficient that its inventor should be worthy
        of a Nobel Prize in economics.</p>
        <p><strong>Collective</strong> incapacitation is the polar
        opposite of selective incapacitation. It applies
        indiscriminately, and to far more defendants than does selective
        incapacitation. It is insouciant to defendants’ personal
        characteristics and the characteristics of their individual
        crimes. By imposing incarceration sentences indiscriminately,
        collective-incapacitation schemes lump together those who are
        unlikely to recidivate with the 7% who offend so frequently they
        account for 70% of all serious crimes.<a href="#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
        <p>“[C]ollective incapacitation policies have only modest
        impacts on crime but can cause enormous increases in prison
        populations.” Campbell, § 2:3 at 44 n 13 (quoting Cohen,
        <em>Incapacitating Criminals</em>). Such policies are
        problematic in other ways:</p>
        <p>“[O]ffenders are incapacitated only as long as their
        confinement lasts. Thus advocates of incapacitating prison
        sentences must logically endorse extremely long terms at
        enormous taxpayer expense. This, in turn, exposes another flaw:
        extended incarceration causes prolonged <strong>harm to prison
        inmates</strong>,<sup>[</sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>]</sup>
        especially non-dangerous ones, as it continues to drain public
        funds.”</p>
        <p>Campbell, § 2:3 at 43 (footnote omitted; emphasis added).</p>
        <p>Literature from the criminology discipline is sharply
        critical of collective incapacitation. The theory “cannot
        provide any standards about how long a sentence should be.”
        Neubauer &amp; Fradella, <em>America’s Courts &amp; the Criminal
        Justice System</em> at 374. “[C]ritics argue that the costs of
        imprisonment typically exceed the benefits gained from
        preventing certain criminals from recidivating by keeping them
        incapacitated.” <em>Id</em>. at 375 (citing Argan A.J. Blockland

        incarceration is part of a social movement that began in the

        <p>Since their inception, the guidelines have been criticized
        for their effect of restraining judicial discretion in favor of
        adhering to predetermined grid-blocks (in the vernacular, for
        “treating defendants as grid-blocks”). Judge Bennett of the
        federal Northern District of Iowa offers suggestions that could
        imbue more active judicial discretion, by overcoming judges
        being subconsciously “anchored” to defendants’ presumptive
        sentencing ranges. Mark W. Bennett, <em>Confronting Cognitive

        <h1><strong>§ 1-3. HISTORY OF THE GUIDELINES.</strong></h1>
        <p>The legislature’s main reason for adopting the guidelines was
        to link “the current and future capacity of state and local
        correctional facilities, serving as an instrument to measure and
        forecast the need for additional correctional resources.”
        Kirkpatrick at 695 (citing Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 2(2)(b) (in
        developing guidelines, “[f]actors relevant to appropriate
        sentencing * * * include effective capacity of state and local
        corrections facilities and other sentencing sanctions
        available”)). Kirkpatrick further explained that the
        legislature</p>
        <p>“viewed sentencing guidelines as a comprehensive and
        effective management tool for the state’s corrections system
        because the guidelines could regulate the utilization of all
        aspects of the system. To the extent the guidelines were keyed
        to available institutional capacity, proponents argued that the
        guidelines could reduce current prison overcrowding and prevent
        future overcrowding.”</p>
        <p>Id. at 697.</p>
        <p>The need to link felony sentences to prison capacity arose
        from the fact that “[b]etween 1977 and 1987, Oregon’s prison
        population more than doubled, with no proportionate increase in
        institutional capacity. Thus, prison overcrowding reached
        critical proportions.” Kirkpatrick at 697. When Oregon began
        work on developing the guidelines, its “prison system was
        operating at 125% of capacity[.]” Bogan at 470.</p>
        <p>The 1985 Legislature created the Criminal Justice Council. Or
        Laws 1985, ch 558, § 2. The legislature “charged the * * *
        Council with a variety of oversight responsibilities involving
        the state criminal justice system.” Kirkpatrick at 698-99. In
        1987, Oregon had a “newly elected governor who “had committed
        himself to a substantial prison expansion program.” <em>Id.</em>
        at 697. Taking its lead from the governor, the 1987
        “[L]egislature approved a bill authorizing the Council to
        develop mandatory sentencing guidelines for felony cases.”
        <em>Id</em>. at 699. But</p>
        <p>“[t]o avoid possible violation of the separation-of-powers
        provision of the state constitution, the legislature gave final
        authority to promulgate the rules to a subgroup of the Council,
        the Sentencing Guidelines Board. The Board consisted of members
        of the Council other than those who were members of the
        legislative or judicial branches of government. The legislature
        thus established the Board as an executive agency and gave its
        guidelines the status of administrative rules.”</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><em>Id</em>. (citing Or Laws 1987, ch 619, § 4(1)).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Kirkpatrick explains,</p>
        <p>“The legislature viewed sentencing guidelines as a rational
        mechanism to help assess the extent of immediate need for
        additional prison capacity as well as to forecast future demand
        for correctional resources. It also viewed sentencing guidelines
        as a comprehensive and effective management tool for the state’s
        correctional system because the guidelines could regulate the
        utilization of all aspects of the system. To the extent the
        guidelines were keyed to available institutional capacity,
        proponents argued that the guidelines could reduce prison
        overcrowding and prevent future overcrowding.”</p>
        <p>Id. at 697 (emphasis added).</p>
        <p>Once developed, the guidelines “would become effective on
        September 1, 1989, without further legislative action unless the
        legislature voted to modify or reject them or provided a
        different effective date.” <em>Id</em>. at 699 n 11. Ultimately,
        the legislature took further action. During its 1989
        session,</p>
        <p>“some members, particularly those new legislators who had not
        previously had a chance to vote on the sentencing guidelines,
        objected to the ‘automatic enactment’ provision. Some members
        also felt that the guidelines should not become law without
        explicit legislative action. Responding to these concerns, the
        1989 Oregon Legislative Assembly took action, officially
        approving the guidelines as promulgated by the State Sentencing
        Guidelines Board.”</p>
        <p><em>Id</em>. at 700.</p>
        <p>But first the legislature changed the guidelines’ effective
        date to November 1, 1989. Or Laws 1989, ch 790, § 6 (codified at
        ORS 137.010(1)). In addition, the legislature instructed the
        board to substantively amend some of the proposed provisions in
        specified ways, and to do so not later than the guidelines’
        effective date. Or Laws 1989, ch 790, §§ 96, 98, and 101. After
        mandating these changes the legislature formally approved the
        guidelines. Or Laws 1989, ch 790, § 87 (legislature “approves
        the sentencing guidelines as developed by the State Sentencing
        Guidelines Board”).</p>
        <p>Because the legislature affirmatively adopted the guidelines,
        they do not have the status of administrative rules; instead,
        they have “the authority of statutory law.” <a

        <p><bon-update year="2023" month="June" deprecated="false"> When
        it adopted the Guidelines, the legislature reserved to itself
        the final authority on Guidelines amendments. ORS 137.667
        provides this authority. It states:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“(1) The Oregon Criminal Justice Commission shall review all
        new legislation that creates new crimes or modifies existing
        crimes. The commission shall adopt by rule any necessary
        modifications to the crime seriousness scale of the guidelines
        to reflect the actions of the Legislative Assembly and may
        classify offenses as person felonies or person misdemeanors for
        purposes of the rules.</p>
        <p>“(2) The commission may adopt by majority vote of all of its
        members who are eligible to vote amendments to the sentencing
        guidelines approved by section 87, chapter 790, Oregon Laws
        1989. The commission shall submit the amendments to the
        Legislative Assembly for its approval. <strong>The amendments do
        not become effective unless approved by the Legislative Assembly
        by law.</strong> The effective date of the amendments is the
        date specified by the Legislative Assembly in the law approving
        the amendments or, if the Legislative Assembly does not specify
        a date, the effective date of the law approving the amendments.
        The Legislative Assembly may by law amend, repeal or supplement
        any of the amendments.</p>
        <p>“(3) The provisions of subsection (2) of this section do not
        apply to amendments to the guidelines adopted by the commission

        </blockquote>
        <p><em>Id.</em> (emphasis added).</p>
        <p>Under ORS 137.667(2), the Criminal Justice Commission, on its
        own initiative, may adopt Guidelines amendments. The commission
        does this pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).
        But under ORS 137.667(2), the commission’s amendments do not
        take effect pursuant to APA provisions. Instead, the commission
        must present its initiated amendments for legislative approval.
        ORS 137.667(2). The legislature then “may by law amend, repeal
        or supplement any of the amendments.” <em>Id.</em> But if the
        legislature fails to approve the amendments, the amendments are
        automatically “repealed on January 1 following adjournment sine
        die of that Legislative Assembly.” ORS 137.667(4).</p>
        <p>But in the following situations, the commission may adopt
        <strong>temporary</strong> rule amendments, rather than have to

        </blockquote>
        <p></bon-update></p>
        <p>Starting in 1993, and in most every legislative session since
        then, the legislature approved guidelines amendments proposed by
        the Criminal Justice Commission (or by its predecessor agency,
        the Criminal Justice Council). But the legislative bills
        adopting the amendments usually did not set out the texts of the
        amended provisions, and did not reflect how the provisions were
        to be amended. An example is the 1995 Legislature’s Senate Bill
        429 (enrolled as Or Laws 1995, ch 520). Its Section 1 merely
        stated, “The Sixty-eighth Legislative Assembly approves the
        amendments to OAR 253-03-001[.]”</p>
        <p>To the extent the bills did not set out the texts of the
        amended provisions, they may have been crafted in violation of
        Article IV, section 22, of the Oregon Constitution, which states
        in relevant part states: “No act shall ever be revised, or
        amended by mere reference to its title, but the act revised, or
        section amended shall be set forth, and published at full
        length. in adopting the amendments.” If the bills were crafted
        in violation of Article IV, section 22, the amendments the
        legislature approved, by passing the bills, are void.</p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals rejected this type of claim in <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15388383326484722255&amp;q=188+or.+app.+318&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1">State
        v. Norris</a>, 188 Or App 318, 72 P3d 103, rev den, 336 Or 126
        (2003). The guidelines, the court held, “were promulgated as
        administrative rules, and administrative rules they remained,
        notwithstanding the legislature’s approval of them.” 188 Or App
        at 343. <em>But see</em> <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=234+Or+App+637&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=16508867296458521816&amp;scilh=0">State
        v. Davilla</a>, 234 Or App 637, 230 P3d 22 (2010) (after holding
        that because the legislature’s delegation of authority to
        develop sentencing guidelines to an administrative body is
        constitutionally permissible, in that the legislature provided
        standards directing the development of the guidelines, ensured
        that its policy directives would be followed, and actually
        certified that those guidelines served its requisite standards,
        court relied on legislative approval of guidelines to reject the
        defendant’s claims that the guidelines constitute an
        unconstitutional delegation of authority by the legislative
        branch to the judicial branch, and that aggravating factors
        identified in the guidelines are unconstitutionally vague).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, <em>Norris</em> provides a useful survey of
        Article IV, section 22 case law. Moreover, the 2003
        Legislature’s HB 2174, which adopted the then-extant guidelines
        in their complete text, did not apply in <em>Norris</em>,
        because it was enacted after Norris’s sentencing. Furthermore,
        the Court of Appeals decided <em>Norris</em> before the Supreme
        Court in <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Dilts+II&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=10581544603438958486&amp;scilh=0">Dilts

        that the guidelines have the authority of statutory law.
        Consequently, <em>Norris</em> may be distinguished, and the
        Article IV, section 22 challenge to guidelines amendments may be
        relitigated in cases arising after the HB 2174’s effective
        date.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the <em>Norris</em> court itself identified an open
        question under Article IV, section 22:</p>
        <p>“An interesting question arises when the legislature actually
        amends the guidelines by statute and then later amends by
        statute that earlier amendment. Arguably, the latter statutory
        amendment would be required to satisfy the publication
        requirement of Article IV, section 22. We need not address that
        issue in this case, however, because neither of the two rules at
        issue was amended by statute and then amended again.”</p>
        <p>188 Or App at 343-44.</p>
        <p>This open question became larger subsequent to passage of HB
        2174, given that bill’s enactment of the then-extant guidelines
        provisions in their entirety.</p>
        <p><a

        v. Pemberton</a>, 226 Or App 285, 203 P3d 326 (2009), suggests
        that the guidelines in are statutes. Relying on HB 2174, the
        court reiterated the principle that any guidelines provision “is
        part of the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines, has been approved by
        the legislature, and therefore has the force of statutory law.”
        <a

        226 Or at 288 (emphasis added; citing <em>inter alia</em> Or
        Laws 2003, ch 453, § 2). The court then relied on that principle
        as part (but not all) of its basis for holding that a specific
        <span class="underline">guidelines provision</span> controls
        over a general <span class="underline">statute</span>.
        <em>Id</em>. This is greatly significant, because administrative
        law principles hold that when an administrative rule conflicts
        with a statute, the statute controls. <em>E.g.</em>, <a

        <h3><strong>§ 1-3.3.1. Intent of Provision.</strong></h3>
        <p>OAR 213-001-0005(1) suggests that the guidelines should be
        accorded the force and effect of administrative rules. <em>See
        also</em> Kirkpatrick at 699 (the legislature gave the
        “guidelines the status of administrative rules”);
        <em>Implementation Manual</em> at 149 (although “the guidelines
        have been approved by the legislature, they retain their status
        as administrative rules”; when they “conflict with statutes, the
        statutory provisions control”). But as explained in Section
        1-3.1, notwithstanding the Court of Appeals’ decision in <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Norris&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=15388383326484722255&amp;scilh=0">Norris</a>,
        given the method of the guidelines’ adoption and maintenance,
        and the 2003 Legislature’s passage of HB 2174, the guidelines
        should be accorded “the authority of statutory law,” rather than
        mere administrative rules. <a

        <p>OAR 213-020-0001 must be read in conjunction with two
        statutes. The first is ORS 137.669, which in pertinent part
        states: “The guidelines adopted under ORS 137.667, together with
        any amendments, supplements or repealing provisions, shall
        control the sentences for all crimes committed after the
        effective date of such guidelines.” ORS 137.669 (emphasis
        added). The second statute is ORS 137.010(1), which provides:
        “The statutes that define offenses impose a duty upon the court
        having jurisdiction to pass sentence * * * for felonies
        committed on or after November 1, 1989, in accordance with rules
        of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission unless otherwise

        <p>It should be mentioned, however, that certain provisions of
        the guidelines replicate criminal code provisions, making the
        criminal code provisions applicable in misdemeanor cases. For
        example, the military service mitigating factor, OAR
        213-008-0002(1)(a)(J), replicates ORS 137.090(2)(a). Because the
        criminal code provision applies generally, ORS 137.090(2)(a) is
        available for use in both misdemeanor and felony cases.</p>

        <p>In a case where it has not or cannot be determined whether
        the crime was committed before, on, or after the guidelines’
        effective date, the guidelines mandate imposition of a
        pre-guidelines sentence. ORS 137.010(2) (“[i]f it cannot be
        determined whether the felony was committed on or after November
        1, 1989, the defendant shall be sentenced as if the felony had
        been committed prior to November 1, 1989”). This convention is
        consistent with the general principle that amendments to the
        criminal code apply prospectively only. ORS 161.035(4).
        Moreover, the convention avoids potential <em>ex post facto</em>
        violations. US Const, Art I, § 10; Or Const, Art I, § 21.

        <p>In 1991, staff of the Criminal Justice Commission’s
        predecessor agency, the Criminal Justice Council, issued an
        advisory opinion on the application of ORS 137.010(2). The
        opinion addressed whether a felony committed sometime between
        June 1989 and July 1990 would be sentenced under the guidelines.
        Staff advised:</p>
        <p>“No. See ORS 137.010(2); ‘If it cannot be determined whether
        the felony was committed on or after November 1, 1989, the
        defendant shall be sentenced as if the felony had been committed
        prior to November 1, 1989.’ A district attorney could avoid the
        problem by drafting an indictment with dates pre or
        post-guidelines depending on how the sentence is to be
        structured. (Advisory #3, September 23, 1991).”</p>

        <h3><strong>§ 1-4.3.1 Intent of Provision.</strong></h3>
        <p>The commentary to this provision states: “The State
        Sentencing Guidelines Board expressly provided that the
        sentencing guidelines do not apply to individuals who have been
        found guilty except for insanity pursuant to ORS 161.295-.403.
        This exception to the guidelines system is recognized by OAR
        [213-009-0002].” <em>Implementation Manual</em> at 152.</p>
        <p>A 1990 Staff Advisory further explained that the guidelines
        do not apply to defendants found guilty except insane. In
        relevant part the advisory states:</p>
        <p>“While the statutory language at ORS 161.319, relating to
        verdict and judgment on these cases, has changed over the years
        from ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’ to the current ‘guilty
        except for insanity,’ these judgments are not considered
        ‘convictions.’ The guidelines criminal history scale scores
        ‘convictions.’ The official commentary to [OAR 213-004-0006],
        Criminal History Scale, provides that ‘a conviction . . . should
        be considered to have occurred upon the pronouncement of
        sentence in open court.’<sup>[]</sup> (Page 51, 1989
        <em>Guidelines Implementation Manual</em>) PSRB offenders are
        not ‘sentenced,’ but are ordered to be placed under the
        jurisdiction of the PSRB pursuant to ORS 161.327. (Advisory #1,

        <p>Furthermore, a person found guilty except insane does not
        receive a “sentence,” <em>per se</em>. Instead, the person is

        provided by statute for the crime for which the person was found

        <p><em>As used in these rules:</em></p>
        <p>(1) “Bench probation” means a probationary sentence, which
        directs the probationer to remain under the supervision and

        <p>(2) “Board” means the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison
        Supervision.</p>
        <p>(3) “Correctional supervision status” means any form of
        incarcerative or non-incarcerative supervision which is served
        by an offender as part of a sentence for a criminal
        conviction.</p>
        <p>(4) “Department” means the Department of Corrections.</p>
        <p>(5) “Departure” means a sentence, except an optional
        probationary sentence, which is inconsistent with the
        presumptive sentence for an offender.</p>
        <p>(6) “Dispositional departure” means a sentence which imposes
        probation when the presumptive sentence is prison or prison when
        the presumptive sentence is probation. An optional probationary
        sentence is not a dispositional departure.</p>
        <p>(7) “Dispositional line” means the solid black line on the
        Sentencing Guidelines Grid (Appendix 1) which separates the grid
        blocks in which the presumptive sentence is a term of
        imprisonment and post-prison supervision from the grid blocks in
        which the presumptive sentence is probation which may include
        local custodial sanctions.</p>
        <p>(8) “Durational departure” means a sentence which is
        inconsistent with the presumptive sentence as to term of
        incarceration, term of supervised probation or number of
        sanction units which may be imposed as a condition of

        <p>Regardless of whether the guidelines should be accorded the
        force and effect of statutes or of administrative rules,
        <em>see</em> Section 1-3.1, the judiciary construes them in
        accordance with the <em>PGE</em> template, 317 Or at 612 n 4
        (principles of statutory construction apply to construction of
        administrative rules), as modified by the 2001 Legislature’s
        House Bill 3677 (codified at ORS 174.020). Under this modified
        template, the judicial function is to construe the statute in
        accordance with the legislative intent. <em>PGE</em>, 317 Or at

        <p>If Oregon models a statute after another state’s statute,

        Council (since renamed the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission)
        in connection with the Felony Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See

        <p>Although this note correctly states that the now-defunct
        Sentencing Guidelines Board authored the guidelines, the note
        wrongly says the Criminal Justice Commission’s predecessor
        agency, the Criminal Justice Council, authored the commentary,
        with that commentary being the “interpretation” of the
        guidelines that the note references. As previously explained, <a

        Rights.</strong></h2>
        <p>In the context of the Oregon’s numerous sentence enhancement
        schemes discussed in this and other chapters, the question
        repeatedly arises: Who may serve as the trier of fact? The jury
        or, even without a jury waiver, the trial court? State and
        federal constitutional law provide subtly different answers.</p>

        v. Wedge</a>, 293 Or 598, 607, 652 P2d 773 (1982) holds that
        under the state constitution’s jury trial clause, “facts which
        go to the criminal acts for which a defendant is to be
        punished”—offense-specific facts—“must be proved to a jury’s
        satisfaction unless admitted or waived.” This rule prohibits
        basing sentence enhancement on offense-specific facts, as
        opposed to facts that pertain to the defendant
        himself—offender-specific facts—unless the offense-specific
        facts were pled and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt
        (unless the defendant waived jury or admitted to the facts).</p>
        <p>Dangerous offender sentencing, ORS 161.725 to 161.737,
        provides an example. The factors that must be proven, in order
        to impose a dangerous offender sentence are a particular type of
        aggravated-departure factor. <em>See</em> <a

        v. New Jersey</a>, 530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435
        (2000)—<em>i.e.</em>, the “<em>Apprendi</em> rule”—states a
        federal constitutional principle similar to but broader than the
        <em>Wedge</em> rule. The <em>Apprendi</em> rule states: “Other
        than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the
        penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must
        be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”
        530 US at 490. The <em>Wedge</em> rule applies to
        offense-specific factors, but not to offender-specific factors.
        The <em>Apprendi</em> rule applies to all types of factors,
        except for those that are based exclusively on the defendant’s
        record of prior convictions.</p>
        <p>The <em>Apprendi</em> rule’s prior-conviction exception
        applies only to adult convictions. As discussed in Chapter 3,
        the guidelines authorize using adult corrections, along with
        certain juvenile adjudications, in setting defendant’s criminal
        history scores. But because juvenile adjudications are not
        convictions per se, they fall outside the <em>Apprendi</em>
        rule’s prior-conviction exception, so fall inside the heart of
        the rule. <a

        the state must prove their existence in compliance with the
        <em>Apprendi</em> rule, as well as with the procedural
        requirements of ORS 136.760 to 136.792, which are discussed

        constitutionally required to be found by a jury in order to

        <p>By virtue of its emergency clause, the bill took effect when
        the governor signed it on July 7, 2005. Or Laws 2005, ch 463, §
        24. The scheme requires the state to give reasonable pretrial
        notice of any enhancement facts it intends to prove, either in
        the accusatory instrument, ORS 136.765(1), or by a less formal
        notice of intent to prove enhancement facts. ORS 136.765(2). If
        the less formal notice is used, it must be given “no later than
        60 days after the defendant is arraigned on an indictment,
        waives indictment or is held to answer following a preliminary
        hearing, or 14 days before trial, whichever occurs earlier,
        unless the parties agree otherwise or the court authorizes a
        later date for good cause shown.” <em>Id.</em><a href="#fn7"

        <p>“All evidence received during the trial phase of a criminal
        proceeding may be considered by the jury or, if the defendant
        waives the right to a jury trial, by the court during the
        sentencing phase of the proceeding.” ORS 136.780. Moreover, the
        evidence code applies during trials on enhancement facts. OEC
        101(4)(d).</p>
        <p>Absent a valid jury waiver, the jury must find enhancement
        facts beyond a reasonable doubt before they may be used to
        aggravate a sentence. But in order to assert his
        <em>Apprendi</em> rights, a defendant is not required to have
        asked the court to empanel a jury to find enhancement facts.
        Seeking such an empanelment is the state’s burden. To assert his
        <em>Apprendi</em> rights, a defendant is required only to object
        to the use of non-juried enhancement facts. <a

        v. Lafferty</a>, 240 Or App 564, 247 P3d 1266 (2011), the court
        addressed ORS 136.776’s jury-waiver provision. In pertinent
        part, that statute provides, “When a defendant waives the right
        to a jury trial on the issue of guilt or innocence, the waiver
        constitutes a written waiver of the right to a jury trial on all
        enhancement facts[.]” <em>Id</em>. In <em>Lafferty</em>, the
        defendant had waived his right to jury trial on the crimes
        charged in the indictment, but he had not expressly waived jury
        on the enhancement fact that the prosecution previously had
        notified him of its intent to use. At sentencing the defendant
        objected to use of that enhancement fact, because (i) he had not
        waived jury on it, and (ii) no jury had found the fact beyond a
        reasonable doubt. The trial court agreed that it could not use
        the enhancement fact to impose sentence, and the state
        appealed.</p>
        <p>On appeal the state claimed that when the defendant waived
        jury on the charges, by operation of ORS 136.776 he
        automatically waived jury on the enhancement fact. The Court of
        Appeals rejected the claim. It explained that “for certain
        fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an
        informed waiver. The waiver of a right to jury trial—including a
        waiver on sentencing enhancement facts—is one of those
        fundamental rights.” <a

        240 Or App at 578 (internal quotation and citation omitted). In
        the face of the defendant’s objections, the Court of Appeals
        said, construing ORS 136.776 as establishing an implied waiver
        would create a constitutional infirmity that the court must
        avoid:</p>
        <p>“To construe the statute the way the state suggests would be
        to say that it overrides the constitutional mandate that a
        waiver of a jury trial on sentencing enhancement facts be an
        ‘intentional’ waiver of a ‘known’ right. That, of course, a
        statute may not do.</p>
        <p>“The plausible reading of ORS 136.776 that does not create
        that constitutional infirmity is that the statute requires that
        a defendant, in order to waive his constitutional right to a
        jury trial on the question of guilt or innocence, must also make
        a knowing and intentional waiver of his right to a jury trial on
        sentencing enhancement facts, and must do so in writing. Read in
        that manner, ORS 136.776 instructs courts and litigants as to
        the form that a waiver of jury trial rights must take. Failure
        to abide by the statute and secure such a waiver—in writing—as
        to both guilt or innocence and sentencing enhancement facts is
        just that, a failure to comply with the statute.”</p>

        but harmless error).</p>
        <p>SB 528 also draws a distinction between offense-specific and
        offender-specific enhancement facts. Offense-specific facts
        generally are to be proved during the “trial” (guilt) phase of a
        defendant’s trial, ORS 136.770(1), whereas offender-specific
        facts always are to be proved during the “sentencing” (penalty)
        phase, if there is one (<em>i.e.</em>, if the defendant is
        convicted of any underlying felonies). ORS 136.770(1). However,
        trial on offense-specific enhancement facts may be deferred to
        the “sentencing” phase. ORS 136.770(1)(a); ORS 136.770(4).
        Uniform Criminal Jury Instructions (OSB 2009 rev with 2010-2017
        supps) provide suggested jury instructions, which cover both
        offense- and offender-specific enhancement facts in “trial”- and
        “sentencing”-phase situations.”</p>
        <p>SB 528 contains three retroactivity clauses. The first clause
        applies the bill to prosecutions commenced before the bill’s
        effective date, even if the alleged criminal conduct was
        committed before the effective date. Or Laws 2005, ch 463, §
        21(1). The second clause applies the bill to cases that have
        never been sentenced, but were pending at the time the bill took
        effect. Or Laws 2005, ch 463, § 21(2). The third clause makes
        the bill retroactive to cases that the appellate courts reversed
        and remanded for resentencing. Or Laws 2005, ch 463, § 21(3).
        <em>See also</em> Section 1-7.2.3. The Oregon Supreme Court has
        held that this retroactive application is not <em>ex post

        den</em>, 346 Or 11 (2009), the Court of Appeals applied
        <em>Harris</em>. There, the trial court imposed 30-year
        indeterminate dangerous-offender sentences on multiple counts.
        In conjunction with each of those sentences, the court imposed
        aggravated-departure sentences as minimum terms. The court
        relied on non-juried aggravating factors to impose the minimums.
        The defendant argued that the trial court’s reliance on the
        non-juried factors violated Sixth Amendment principles. Relying
        on <em>Harris</em>, the Court of Appeals held that Sixth
        Amendment principles did not apply to the aggravating factors,
        because the departure sentences, as minimums, did not “exceed
        the prescribed [30-year] statutory maximum sentence for [each]

        conjunction with the life sentence, the court imposed an
        enhanced, seven-year minimum, instead of the presumptive
        five-year minimum. The court relied on non-juried findings to
        impose the enhanced minimum. The Supreme Court reversed, and did
        so by expressly overruling <em>Harris</em>. The Court
        stated:</p>
        <p>“<em>Harris</em> drew a distinction between facts that
        increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase only the
        mandatory minimum. We conclude that this distinction is
        inconsistent with our decision in <em>Apprendi v. New
        Jersey</em>, 530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000),
        and with the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Any fact
        that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an ‘element’
        that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable
        doubt. <em>See id.</em>, at 483, n. 10, 490. Mandatory minimum
        sentences increase the penalty for a crime. It follows, then,
        that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an
        ‘element’ that must be submitted to the jury. Accordingly,
        <em>Harris</em> is overruled.”</p>

        <p>There should be no question that <em>Alleyne</em> overruled
        <em>Stephens sub silentio</em>. That means that under
        <em>Alleyne</em>, the aggravating factors on which a trial court
        might rely, to impose an aggravated departure as the minimum
        component of a longer, dangerous-offender sentence, are subject
        to Sixth Amendment principles—that is, the aggravating factors
        are subject to the <a

        <p>But <em>Upton</em> should not be so read. The court addressed
        a series of challenges to SB 528. These included the claim that
        the bill “creates a procedure under which a jury determines
        aggravating or enhancing factors, but does not do the same for
        mitigating factors, [so] it is a ‘one-sided’ rule of the type

        in Oregon courts.” <em>Id</em>. at 599. That body of law
        “indicates that post-conviction relief is, in fact, available

        ‘whether an issue reasonably could be anticipated and raised
        does not depend—at least not in a <em>per se</em> way—on whether
        the issue has been definitively resolved by the courts.’ Rather,
        the question whether a claim reasonably could have been raised
        earlier will vary with the facts and circumstances of each
        claim. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Long</em>:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“‘The touchstone is not whether a particular question is
        settled, but whether it reasonably is to be anticipated so that
        it can be raised and settled accordingly. The more settled and
        familiar a constitutional or other principle on which a claim is
        based, the more likely the claim reasonably should have been
        anticipated and raised. Conversely, if the constitutional
        principle is a new one, or if its extension to a particular
        statute, circumstance, or setting is novel, unprecedented, or
        surprising, then the more likely the conclusion that the claim
        reasonably could not have been raised.’</p>

        <p>Because of the sluggishness of processes such as appellate
        review, by the time of the remand proceeding, a new charging
        instrument may be beyond the statute of limitations.
        <em>See</em> ORS 131.105 and 131.125. Because the limitations
        period tolls (for no more than three years, <em>see</em> ORS
        131.155) only when the defendant is residing outside the state
        or is hiding to prevent service of process, <em>see</em> ORS
        131.145(2), it does not toll merely because the case is on
        appeal or on some other form of review. <em>See</em> <a

        <p>The second problem with allowing jury resentencing trials
        arises where the state seeks to prove offense-specific

        may be tried during a sentencing phase. This is because nothing
        in ORS 136.790 and ORS 136.792 authorizes sentencing trials on
        offense-specific enhancement facts.
        <bon-update year="2024" month="Jan" deprecated="false" display="inline"><a

        <p>It should be noted, however, that when imposing sentence at
        the sentencing hearing, the court may use offense- and
        offender-specific facts found during the case’s earlier “trial”
        and “sentencing” phases.</p>
        <p>Next, on remand defense counsel also should argue that double
        jeopardy prohibits any sort of sentencing trial on enhancement
        facts. Under this theory, the only enhancement facts available
        for the court’s use would be those that the state proved during
        the original trial.</p>
        <p>Under the Fifth Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause, a
        conviction of a lesser-included offense precludes a subsequent
        prosecution on the associated greater offense. <a

        <em>Apprendi</em> rule—so enhancement facts—are crime elements
        for purposes of double jeopardy analyses. The Court said,</p>
        <p>“Our decision in <em>Apprendi</em> * * * clarified what
        constitutes an ‘element’ of an offense for purposes of the Sixth
        Amendment’s jury trial guarantee. Put simply, if the existence
        of any fact (other than a prior conviction) increases the
        maximum punishment that may be imposed on a defendant, that
        fact—no matter how the State labels it—constitutes an element,
        and must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
        <p>“ * * * * *</p>
        <p>“We can think of no principled reason to distinguish, in this
        context, between what constitutes an offense for purposes of the

        ‘offence’ for purposes of the Fifth Amendment’s Double Jeopardy
        Clause.”</p>

        <p>PRACTICE TIP: Defense counsel should rely on <em>Price</em>
        and <em>Sattazahn</em> to argue that when the prosecution
        secures a valid guilty verdict on the underlying felony, but
        fails to secure valid guilty verdicts on any enhancement facts,
        what the prosecution has secured is a valid guilty verdict on a
        lesser-included offense, with the lesser-included being the
        underlying felony. The associated greater offense is the
        underlying felony aggravated by any enhancement facts on which
        the state failed to secure valid guilty verdicts. Any
        resentencing trial on enhancement facts, or any effort to reopen
        the “trial” phase to try offense-specific enhancement facts (as
        was done in <em>Morris</em>), should be barred, because
        conviction on the lesser-included offense creates a
        double-jeopardy bar to subsequent prosecution for the greater
        offense.</p>
        <p>There is one last aspect of the resentencing authority,
        purportedly conferred by ORS 136.792, which should be addressed.
        The 2005 Legislature created that statute when it passed Senate
        Bill 528 (2005) (enrolled as Oregon Laws, chapter 463; codified
        at ORS 136.760 to 136.792). At that time, hundreds of cases were
        on appeal that potentially could be reversed and remanded
        because prosecutors relied on the then-prevailing law, e.g., <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6575003508109610240&amp;q=336+Or+158&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38">State
        v. Dilts I</a>, 336 Or 158, 82 P3d 593 (2003), vacated sub nom,
        Dilts v. Oregon, 542 US 934 (2004) (mem.), which wrongly held
        that the <a

        rule did not apply to aggravated-departure factors. <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9590772109734549803&amp;q=State+v.+Upton&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38"><em>Upton</em></a>,
        339 Or at 678, establishes that even before the Court’s
        <em>Apprendi</em>-clarification decision in <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Blakely+v.+Washington&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38&amp;case=16163203473167624369&amp;scilh=0">Blakely</a>,
        prosecutors could have secured jury trials on aggravating
        factors (presumably using the reasonable-doubt standard).
        Nevertheless, pre-<em>Blakely</em>, prosecutors could have
        reasonably relied on cases such as <em>Dilts I</em>, by waiting
        until sentencing hearings to seek to prove aggravating factors.
        The 2005 Legislature thus could have concluded that in all
        fairness, it should allow prosecutors, who relied on cases such
        as <em>Dilts I</em>, a post-<em>Blakely</em> opportunity on
        remand to prove aggravating factors consistent with
        <em>Apprendi</em>-rule requirements.</p>
        <p>But in cases originally sentenced after the Court’s decision
        in <em>Blakely</em>, prosecutors could not reasonably have
        relied on <em>Dilts I</em>—particularly because just four days
        after deciding <em>Blakely</em>, the Court vacated <em>Dilts
        I</em>. Since <em>Blakely</em>, prosecutors have been well aware
        of the application of the Apprendi rule and its
        requirements—including those imposed by SB 528. In cases that
        originally were sentenced after the Court’s decision in
        <em>Blakely</em>, and then were reversed and remanded for
        resentencing owing to violations of the Apprendi rule and its
        requirements, defense counsel should argue that ORS 136.790 and
        136.792 should be construed as precluding a “second bite at the
        apple” for prosecutors who, at original sentencing, could have
        and should have complied with <em>Apprendi</em>-rule
        requirements, but violated the rule anyway.</p>

        <h2><strong>§ 1-7.3. Specific Attacks—Due Process.</strong></h2>
        <p>Several due process principles apply in sentencing hearings.
        With respect to the defendant: “Due process * * * requires that
        [1] he be present [2] with counsel, [3] have an opportunity to
        be heard, [4] be confronted with the witnesses against him, [5]
        have the right to cross-examine, and [6] to offer evidence of
        his own. And [7] there must be findings adequate to make
        meaningful any appeal that is allowed.” <a

        <p>Oregon law appears to meet these due process requirements.
        For example:</p>
        <p>• The test for adequacy of notice is whether the notice was
        “‘reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise

        S Ct 652, 95 L Ed 865 (1950)). Under SB 528, the state must give
        defendants reasonable notice of what the bill generically calls
        sentence “enhancement facts,” <em>i.e.</em>, facts that are
        subject to constitutional jury-trial requirements. <em>See</em>
        ORS 136.760(2). Moreover, OAR 213-013-0010(5) requires that any
        presentence investigation report (PSI) provide factual
        information regarding the defendant’s criminal history, and
        aggravating factors on which a departure sentence could be
        based. A PSI must be filed at least five judicial days before
        sentencing. ORS 137.079(1).</p>
        <p>• ORS 137.030 requires the defendant’s presence at a felony
        sentencing. If a trial court wishes to amend a defendant’s
        sentence substantively, as opposed to making administrative
        amendments (<em>i.e.</em>, amendments made to correct technical
        sentencing errors in the judgment), the court must do so in open
        court with the defendant and defense counsel present. See

        <p>• ORS 137.090(1)(c) declares that evidence is admissible only
        if the court finds that it is “trustworthy and reliable.” This
        appears to be a codification of constitutional confrontation
        clause requirements, for the phrase “trustworthy and reliable”
        often is used as a shorthand description of the
        confrontation-clause test. <em>See</em> Section 1-7.7.</p>
        <p>ORS 137.020(2)(a) bears on the first two bulleted items
        above:</p>
        <p>“The time appointed shall be at least two calendar days after
        the plea or verdict if the court intends to remain in session so
        long. If the court does not intend to remain in session at least
        two calendar days, the time appointed may be sooner than two
        calendar days, but shall be as remote a time as can reasonably
        be allowed. However, in the latter case, the judgment shall not
        be given less than six hours after the plea or verdict, except
        with the consent of the defendant.”</p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals explained that the purpose of this
        statute</p>
        <p>“is ‘to give the defendant time for such further proceedings
        as may be deemed necessary to protect his rights, including the
        right to file a motion for new trial or in arrest of judgment.’
        <em>Boykin v. State</em>, 190 P2d 471, 472 (Okla Crim App 1948).
        In a similar vein, the Kentucky Court of Appeals described the
        purpose of that state’s parallel statute as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“‘[I]t contains a most solemn and vital right of the accused.
        Its meaning is upon the surface. It requires no reflection to
        understand it. It was enacted for the express purpose of giving
        the accused time in which to show cause against the sentence
        about to be passed upon him.’</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>“<em>Powers v. Commonwealth</em>, 83 SW 146, 148 (Ky App
        1904).</p>
        <p>“Thus, for example, a defendant might rely on the statutory
        right in order to (1) consider calling witnesses or adducing
        other mitigating evidence at sentencing; (2) prepare for his or
        her allocution; and (3) prepare motions—such as defendant’s
        motion to challenge one of his previous DUII convictions in this
        case—relating to the duration, terms, and conditions of the
        sentence, where uncertain issues of law may be implicated.”</p>

        <p>In <em>Dawson</em>, the trial court erroneously denied the
        defendant’s request for a two-calendar-day delay. Instead, the
        court allowed him only a 30-second delay. 252 Or App at 87.
        Rejecting the state’s claim that the defendant had not shown
        that he was prejudiced by the error, the Court of Appeals
        reversed. It explained:</p>
        <p>“[T]here also is another, more subtle, purpose instinct
        [<em>sic</em>] in statutes like ORS 137.020(2)(a); that is, to
        create a measure of distance between the sentencing proceeding
        and the momentum to pronounce final judgment that often exists
        in the wake of a criminal trial.</p>
        <p>“That concern is manifest in this case. The trial judge
        acknowledged that the case had had an emotional impact on him;
        on at least two occasions, he expressed strong contempt for
        defendant as a perjurer and dangerous individual. The issue
        before us is not whether the court’s assessment of defendant’s
        character was accurate. Nor is the issue whether, given more
        time to reflect, the court would have imposed the same or a
        different sentence. Rather, our focus is on the court’s
        disregard of an important statutory right that has existed in
        this state for more than a century and a half and whose purpose,
        in part, is to ensure the deliberate and carefully considered
        pronouncement of judgment in criminal cases. On the record
        before us, the court’s error prejudiced defendant with respect
        to a substantial right.”</p>

        <p>Finally, it is well worth recognizing that sentencing laws
        may be challenged under due process vagueness principles. For
        example, in <a
        href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-7120_p86b.pdf">Johnson
        v. United States</a>, 576 US ___, 135 S Ct 2551, 192 L Ed 2d 569
        (2015), the Court answered a due process vagueness challenge to
        the so-called “residual clause” of the federal Armed Career
        Criminal Act. That clause applies to any felony that “involves
        conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
        injury to another.” The lower courts applied the clause to the
        defendant’s prior conviction for unlawful possession of a
        sawed-off shotgun. The Supreme Court reversed on the grounds
        that (i) the clause ties the judicial assessment of risk to a
        judicially imagined “ordinary case” of a crime, rather than to
        real-world facts or statutory elements; and (ii) the clause
        leaves grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by
        a crime.</p>

        <h2><strong>§ 1-7.4. Specific Attacks—Notice of Intent to Prove
        Enhancement Facts.</strong></h2>
        <p>Felony cases subject to SB 528’s requirements for proving
        “enhancement facts” frequently present a serious pleading
        problem. In a case where the defendant awaits original
        sentencing, the bill originally authorized the state to notify a
        defendant of its intent to prove enhancement facts either by
        “[p]leading the enhancement fact in the accusatory instrument,”
        or, “[w]ithin a reasonable time after filing the accusatory
        instrument, providing written notice to the defendant of the
        enhancement fact[.]” ORS 136.765(2).</p>
        <p>Similar to pre-sentencing cases, in a case where the
        defendant is awaiting a resentencing ordered by a reviewing
        court, the bill authorizes the state to notify a defendant of
        its intent to prove enhancement facts by providing, “within a
        reasonable time before resentencing, * * * written notice to the
        defendant of the enhancement fact and the state’s intention to
        rely on it.” ORS 136.790.</p>
        <p>The 2011 Legislature amended ORS 136.765(2), but not ORS
        136.790. As amended, ORS 136.765(2) provides that the
        prosecution must give notice of its intent to prove enhancement
        facts “no later than 60 days after the defendant is arraigned on
        an indictment, waives indictment or is held to answer following
        a preliminary hearing, or 14 days before trial, whichever occurs
        earlier, unless the parties agree otherwise or the court
        authorizes a later date for good cause shown.” The bill took
        effect on June 7, 2011, and applies “to criminal prosecutions
        commenced on or after [its] effective date[.]” Or Laws 2011, ch
        267, § 2.</p>
        <p>Pre-amendment case law should provide guidance on what
        constitutes “good cause shown” under ORS 136.765(2), and
        provides guidance on what constitutes “a reasonable time before
        resentencing,” as ORS 136.790 still requires. For example, the
        Court of Appeals held that where the state gave notice of intent
        several months after indictment, but promptly after SB 528 took
        effect, the timing was reasonable. <a

        v. Wick</a>, 216 Or App 404, 410–11, 173 P3d 1231 (2007).</p>
        <p>Moreover, in <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=231+Or+App+263&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=8386834660787049611&amp;scilh=0">State
        v. Roberts</a>, 231 Or App 263, 273, 219 P3d 41 (2009), the
        court</p>
        <p>“conclude[d] that the requirement of ORS 136.765 that the
        state provide a defendant with notice of its intention to rely
        on enhancement facts ‘[w]ithin a reasonable time’ is intended to
        be time sufficient to allow the defendant to prepare a defense
        against those particular enhancement facts. Whether a time is
        adequate for a defendant to prepare a defense will depend on the
        circumstances in each case. One of those circumstances is
        whether the enhancement fact is one that will be submitted at
        the guilt phase or at the sentencing phase of the criminal
        proceeding.”</p>
        <p>In <em>Roberts</em>, the day before trial the state gave the
        defendant notice of its intent to seek two enhancement facts.
        Both</p>
        <p>“enhancement facts related to defendant[, <em>i.e.</em>, were
        offender specific,] and would not be tried until the sentencing
        phase of defendant’s criminal proceeding. <em>See</em> ORS
        136.773. There is no indication in the text of ORS 136.765 or in
        its legislative history that the legislature intended the guilt
        phase of the criminal proceeding to be the deadline for notice
        of all enhancement facts, whether they be related to the offense
        or related to the defendant.</p>
        <p>“Instead, the question before us is whether defendant had an
        adequate time to prepare his defense against the enhancement
        facts alleged in this case—that is, the facts that he was on
        post-prison supervision when he committed the offenses and that
        he has been persistently involved in similar offenses. The
        answer to that question is straightforward in this case,
        especially in light of the fact that defendant has made no
        assertion to the contrary. Regardless, we conclude that he had
        ample time to prepare a defense. After the guilty verdict,
        defendant requested one week to prepare for sentencing; the
        court scheduled the sentencing hearing nearly two weeks out. The
        enhancement facts at issue in this case—that defendant was on
        post-prison supervision when he committed the offenses and that
        he had been persistently involved in similar offenses—are
        straightforward allegations for which nearly two weeks is
        sufficient time to prepare a defense, particularly in the
        absence of any contrary contention by the defendant.”</p>
        <p><em>Roberts</em>, 231 Or App at 273 (court’s emphasis).</p>
        <p><strong>PRACTICE TIP:</strong> The <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=231+Or+App+263&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=8386834660787049611&amp;scilh=0">Roberts</a>
        court may well have decided the case differently if the case had
        involved offense-specific enhancement facts, because then the
        facts most likely would had to have been tried in guilt phase,
        rather than in the penalty phase. Had that been the situation,
        the defendant would have had only one day before trial to
        prepare an adequate defense to the enhancement facts.
        Consequently, Roberts provides no real guidance guidance on the
        meaning of the phrase, “[w]ithin a reasonable time,” in the
        context of notices of intent to prove offense-specific
        enhancement facts.</p>
        <p>In <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5244680610375180009&amp;q=236+Or.+App.+350&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State
        v. Boitz</a>, 236 Or App 350, 236 P3d 766 (2010), the state
        submitted a notice of intent to prove enhancement facts,
        alleging that the defendant was on release pending criminal
        charges when he committed his crime. But at that time the
        defendant was on probation for prior convictions, and no charges
        were pending against him. He moved for judgment of acquittal on
        the alleged enhancement fact, and then appealed the trial
        court’s denial of his motion. The state then</p>
        <p>“argue[d] that the trial court correctly determined that
        defendant’s probationary status established that defendant was
        on release status from pending criminal charges. In addition,
        the state argue[d] that, even if proof that defendant was on
        probation is not proof that he was on release from ‘pending
        criminal charges,’ that variance was ‘not a material aspect of
        the allegation and was surplusage.’”</p>
        <p><em>Boitz</em>, 236 Or App at 353.</p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals rejected these arguments. It
        explained,</p>
        <p>“The state’s written notice provided defendant with notice of
        an enhancement fact that alleged that defendant committed the
        crimes while he was on release from ‘pending criminal charges.’
        We agree with defendant that proof that he was on probation is
        not proof that he was on release from ‘pending criminal
        charges.’ Consequently, the state did not prove the enhancement
        fact as alleged in its notice.”</p>
        <p><em>Id</em>. at 354.</p>
        <p>With regards to the state’s alternative argument, that the
        variance between its proof and the allegation in its notice of
        intent was “not a material aspect of the allegation and was
        surplusage,” the court explained that the argument presents</p>
        <p>“an issue of first impression: whether a trial court could
        permissibly find a sentencing enhancement fact that varies in
        some manner from the enhancement fact alleged in the state’s
        notice pursuant to ORS 136.765.</p>
        <p>“A defendant’s decision whether to elect to have a jury or
        the court determine the facts alleged in the state’s sentencing
        enhancement fact notice implicates similar concerns as those
        confronted by a defendant deciding whether to have a jury or the
        trial court determine the facts alleged in an accusatory
        instrument.”</p>
        <p><em>Id</em>. at 355.</p>
        <p>The court “[c]onclude[d] that any variance between the
        allegations in the sentencing enhancement fact notice and the
        proof at sentencing may be permissible only if it satisfies the
        test described in [<a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=179+Or+App+1&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=16203122264413544179&amp;scilh=0">State
        v. Newman</a>, 179 Or App 1, 7, 39 P3d 874 (2002)].” <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=236+Or+App+350&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=5244680610375180009&amp;scilh=0">Id</a>.
        Applying that conclusion, the court held:</p>
        <p>“Under [the <em>Newman</em>] test, the variance here is not
        permissible. We need not decide whether the phrase ‘pending
        criminal charges’ is material to the state’s allegation of a
        sentencing enhancement fact because, even if the state is
        correct that the phrase does not relate to a ‘material element’
        of the sentencing enhancement fact, the second prong of the
        test—whether the variance between the allegation and the proof
        caused prejudice to defendant’s defense of this case—controls
        the outcome of this case. Whether a variance is prejudicial
        depends on the specific theories under which a case is argued.
        Specifically, where an amendment would require a defendant to
        develop a different argument, the amendment is prejudicial to
        defendant.</p>
        <p>“Here, defendant defended against the second enhancement fact
        on the theory that he did not commit this offense while criminal
        charges were pending. Accordingly, because defendant believed
        that he could defeat the second enhancement fact on that theory,
        the amendment of the notice to excise that phrase would have
        required defendant to develop a different theory to refute that
        enhancement fact. Thus, such an amendment would have been
        prejudicial in this case.[]</p>
        <p>“The fact that defendant had notice that his probationary
        status was at issue under the first enhancement fact is
        immaterial to our conclusion. The issue is not whether defendant
        could have presented alternative theories to defeat a different
        enhancement fact; the issue is whether defendant would be
        prejudiced by a finding that differed from the language in the
        notice.”</p>
        <p><em>Id</em>. at 356.</p>
        <p>Finally, in <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2146171932880182182&amp;q=255+Or+App+594&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38">State
        v. Alexander</a>, 255 Or App 594, 298 P3d 55 (2013), the notice
        of intent listed 18 potential aggravating factors and, without
        specifying any particular factor on which the prosecution
        intended to rely, told the defendant only that the state “may”
        seek an aggravated-departure sentence. Given this lack of
        specificity, the Court of Appeals held that the notice did not
        meet the requirements of ORS 136.765(2), and invalidated the
        aggravated departure the trial court subsequently imposed. The
        court explained:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Given the statutory text in the totality of its context, it
        is patent that the legislature intended an ‘enhancement fact’ to
        be a specific thing and not—as the state would have it—an entire
        constellation of unspecified possible things. Accordingly, a
        ‘notice’ that the state ‘may’ rely on any of individual
        departure factors (including some ineffable ‘[o]ther’)—or any
        combination thereof<sup>5</sup>—is the functional equivalent of
        ‘That’s for us to know and you to find out.’ It is no notice at
        all.<br />
        ____________<br />
        “<sup>5</sup> In the abstract, and without accounting for the
        unrestrictive nature of ‘[o]ther,’ the State’s position embraces
        at least 262,143 possible combinations of sentencing
        factors.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        v. Teeters</a>, 278 Or App 812, 379 P3d 839 (2016) (<em>per
        curiam</em>), the defendant challenged the trial court’s
        imposition of an aggravated departure on multiple grounds,
        including that the court relied on one or more enhancement facts
        the state had not included in its notice of intent. The Court of
        Appeals agreed that “the sentencing court erred to the extent it
        relied on any enhancement fact other than those [contained in
        the state’s notice] to increase [the] sentence.” 278 Or App at
        814. <em>See also</em> <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17047576215171544442&amp;q=280+Or+App+43&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State
        v. Davilla</a>, 280 Or App 43, 65, 380 P3d 1003 (2016) (where it
        was unclear whether trial court, in imposing departure sentence,
        relied on enhancement facts other than those on which the state
        gave notice of intent, Court of Appeals concluded that it “must
        remand for resentencing”).</p>
        <p>But there remains a fundamental constitutional problem with
        notices of intent to prove enhancement facts. In almost all
        felony cases, the accusatory instrument is an indictment.
        Indictments are returned by the grand jury, not by a state
        prosecutor. <em>See</em> <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Gonzales&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=7212687640111209177&amp;scilh=0">State

        den</em>, 293 Or 104 (1982) (rather than being “an investigative
        tool of the prosecutor,” the grand jury “is part of the judicial
        branch”). If the state pleads enhancement facts in a separate
        notice of intent, the defendant may argue that the enhancement
        facts may not be submitted to the jury. This is because “each
        aggravating or enhancing factor is a new ‘material element’ of
        the charged offense[.]” <a

        rule does not apply to factual findings required to impose a
        fine upon conviction, the United States Supreme Court
        observed:</p>
        <p>“This argument has two defects. First, it rests on an
        assumption that <a

        and its progeny have uniformly rejected: that in determining the
        maximum punishment for an offense, there is a constitutionally
        significant difference between a fact that is an ‘element’ of
        the offense and one that is a ‘sentencing factor.’ <em>See,
        e.g.</em>, 530 US at 478; <a

        <p>Because a notice of intent is not issued by the grand jury,
        but instead is issued by the district attorney, the only
        charging instrument it possibly may be is a district attorney’s
        information. So although a notice of intent is not labeled an
        information, it serves the same function as an information, so
        may be labeled an “information-in-fact.” The defendant may be
        tried on the allegations of an information, or an
        information-in-fact, only if (a) he waives his right to grand
        jury indictment on the allegations, Or Const, Art VII (Amended),
        § 5(3), or (b) he is afforded a preliminary hearing on the
        allegations, or (c) he waives both grand jury and preliminary
        hearing on the allegations. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), § 5(4)
        and (5).</p>
        <p>It is important to recognize the fundamental significance of
        Article VII (Amended), section 5. District attorneys initiate
        prosecutions, but not without judicial review (or the
        defendant’s waiver of his right to judicial review). If a
        district attorney wishes to proceed to trial on an information
        in a felony case, then assuming no waiver by the defendant, the
        judiciary checks the charging decision by conducting a
        preliminary hearing. Or Const, Art VII (Amended), § 5(5).
        Otherwise, and again assuming no waiver by the defendant, the
        judiciary checks the charging decision by requiring the district
        attorney to present his case to the grand jury. Or Const, Art
        VII (Amended), § 5(3). <em>See also</em> <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Gonzales&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=7212687640111209177&amp;scilh=0">Gonzales</a>,
        56 Or App at 20-21 (the grand jury “is part of the judicial
        branch”).</p>
        <p>Thus, Article VII (Amended), section 5 establishes that
        judicial review of district attorneys’ charging decisions is
        part of the checks and balances inherent within the state
        constitution’s separation of powers. As the Supreme Court has
        explained:</p>
        <p>“Subsection (6) of Article VII (Amended), section 5,
        addresses the amendment of those accusatory instruments and
        provides that the state may file an amended ‘indictment or
        information’ when a court rules that that instrument is
        ‘defective in form.’ Although that text is permissive, this
        court has long recognized that we must read it in conjunction
        with subsections (3) to (5) of section 5 and that, when read
        together, those provisions impose limits on the power of the
        prosecutor. The constitutionally required roles of the grand
        jury and the magistrate in felony cases operate as a check on
        the power of the district attorney and serve a critical function
        in protecting individual liberties. <em>See</em> [<a

        v. Freeland</a>, 295 Or 367, 369, 667 P2d (1983) (discussing
        role of magistrate). Thus, this court has held that, although
        Article VII (Amended), section 5(6), permits district attorneys
        to file amended accusatory instruments to correct defects that
        are purely matters of form, the state must return to the grand
        jury or a magistrate if it wishes to make substantive amendments
        to felony indictments or informations.”</p>

        345 Or at 484.</p>
        <p>These separation of powers principles support the claim that
        to the extent SB 528 authorizes district attorneys to avoid
        judicial review of their decisions to charge “enhancement
        facts,” by pleading them in informations-in-fact that are exempt
        from preliminary hearings, the bill violates the state
        constitution’s separation of powers. Or Const, Art III, § 1.</p>
        <p>Finally, it must be recognized that despite these various
        arguments that pleading enhancement facts in a “notice of
        intent” without a preliminary hearing is unconstitutional, in <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2315520676881622046&amp;q=354+Or+98&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48"><em>State

        court held that such pleading is constitutional. The crux of the
        <em>Reinke</em> court’s decision is that the Oregon Constitution
        requires the grand jury to find and plead only the elements of
        the crime as defined by the legislature. According to
        <em>Reinke</em>, the legislature has not defined
        sentence-enhancement facts as elements of a crime; therefore,
        prosecutors may use notices of intent, without preliminary
        hearings, as an alternative means of notifying defendants of
        sentence enhancements facts.</p>

        and held that the trial court did not err by relying on
        enhancement factors that were not approved by a grand jury or
        through a preliminary hearing. This was, however, a baffling
        decision. <em>Hurtado</em> held that an information followed by
        preliminary hearing is an acceptable substitute for indictment
        and meets due process requirements. 110 US at 538. Thus, one
        type of proceeding or the other <strong>may</strong> be used,
        but one or the other type <strong>must</strong> be used. Yet the
        <em>Newkirk</em> court wrote in violation of due process,
        because that court claimed that <em>Hurtado</em> allows ignoring
        <strong>both</strong> types of proceedings. </bon-update></p>
        <p>But the <em>Reinke</em> court failed to recognize and address
        the fact that its decision conflicts with the court’s earlier
        decision in Upton. There, the indictment alleged two enhancement
        facts: Aggravating Factor B, particularly vulnerable victim, OAR
        213-008-0002(1)(b)(B), and Aggravating Factor D, persistent
        involvement in similar offenses, OAR 213-008-0002(1)(b)(D)). 339
        Or at 676. Relying on the then-extant version of ORS 132.540(2),
        defendant Upton demurred to the Factor D allegation. The statute
        stated: “The indictment shall not contain allegations that the
        defendant has previously been convicted of the violation of any
        statute which may subject the defendant to enhanced penalties,
        except where the conviction constitutes a material element of
        the crime charged.” <em>Id.</em> (emphasis added). The trial
        court sustained the demurrer the Factor D allegation.

        criminal defendant can require the state to prove to a jury
        beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>Upton</em>, 339 Or at 681.
        Moreover, the court explained, SB 528 “now permits the pleading
        of an ‘enhancement fact’ in an accusatory instrument. As a

        <p><strong>PRACTICE TIP</strong>: ORS 161.095(2) states: “Except
        as provided in ORS 161.105, a person is not guilty of an offense
        unless the person acts with a culpable mental state with respect
        to each material element of the offense that necessarily
        requires a culpable mental state.” The ORS 161.105 exceptions
        apply to offenses within the criminal code but are “violations”
        rather than “crimes,” and to crimes defined outside the criminal
        code. Aggravating factors typically are attached to crimes
        defined within the criminal code. Consequently, under the cases
        cited above, defense counsel should argue that because
        aggravating factors are attached to crimes within the criminal
        code, the factors are material elements carrying culpable mental
        states. ORS 161.095(2).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a><em><br />
        <br />
        </em>The same argument may be made with respect to
        subclassification factors discussed in Chapter 2. Such factors
        are used to increase crime seriousness levels.</p>
        <p>Nearly 30 years worth of case law holds that
        subclassification factors do not carry mental state
        requirements. Section 2-1.2. But <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12618102844565582188&amp;q=288+Or+App+364&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State
        v. Morris</a>, 288 Or App 364, 372-75, 404 P3d 951 (2017) holds
        that like aggravating factors, subclassification factors are
        “enhancement facts”—<em>i.e.</em>, they are facts that are
        subject to the <em>Apprendi</em> rule, in that they are
        “constitutionally required to be found by a jury in order to
        increase the sentence that may be imposed upon conviction of a
        crime.” ORS 136.760(2). Consequently, under the cases cited
        above, defense counsel should argue that because
        subclassification factors are attached to crimes within the
        criminal code, the factors are material elements carrying
        culpable mental states. ORS 161.095(2). </bon-update></p>
        <p>Finally, the court concluded:</p>
        <p>“The trial court in this case did, as a matter of law, have
        the authority to submit the alleged ‘persistent involvement’ and
        ‘vulnerable victim’ enhancement factors to a jury in compliance
        with the [defendant’s] constitutional jury trial right * * * .
        Consequently, the trial court’s ruling that it did not have the
        authority to submit the alleged enhancing factors to the jury at
        defendant’s trial was error.”</p>
        <p><em>Upton</em>, 339 Or at 688.</p>
        <p>This part of the <em>Upton</em> court’s opinion
        mischaracterizes the trial court’s ruling. The trial court never
        ruled that it lacked “the authority to submit the alleged
        enhancing factors to the jury”; it only ruled—albeit
        erroneously—that the indictment alleged Aggravating Factor D in
        the violation of the then-extant version of ORS 132.540(2). That
        ruling left the state free to submit the indictment’s other
        alleged enhancement fact, Aggravating Factor B. Moreover, the
        <em>Upton</em> court failed to consider ORS 136.765(2), which
        necessarily was at issue in the case, and which, by its terms,
        authorized submitting Aggravating Factor D to the jury, by
        allowing the state to allege it in a notice of intent.</p>
        <p>In any event, as mentioned, the <em>Upton</em> court decided
        the case by exercising the “extraordinary remedy” of granting
        mandamus relief. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7113876950529889849&amp;q=326+Or+607&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State
        ex rel Carlile v. Frost</a>, 326 Or 607, 620, 956 P2d 202
        (1998). This implicates ORS 34.110, which states:</p>
        <p>“A writ of mandamus may be issued to any inferior court * * *
        to compel the performance of an act which the law specially
        enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station;
        but though the writ may require such court * * * to exercise
        judgment, or proceed to the discharge of any functions, it shall
        not control judicial discretion.”</p>
        <p>(Emphasis added.)</p>
        <p>Thus, the Supreme Court may not exercise mandamus
        jurisdiction to tell a lower court how to exercise discretion
        within its permissible range. It may exercise mandamus
        jurisdiction only to compel the exercise of a judicial function
        the court is legally obliged to perform, including by reining in
        a court that has acted outside its permissible range of
        discretion. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15088792834699755160&amp;q=317+Or+615&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38">State
        ex rel Keisling v. Norblad</a>, 317 Or 615, 623, 860 P2d 241
        (1993).</p>
        <p>This means that when the <em>Upton</em> court granted
        mandamus relief, it necessarily concluded—as a matter of
        law—that enhancement facts, such as aggravating factors, are
        “material elements” whose inclusion in indictments is not just
        allowed, but is required. After all, the only issue actually
        before the court was the validity of the trial court’s order
        sustaining the defendant’s demurrer to the indictment’s
        allegation of Aggravating Factor D. If an indictment’s
        allegation of enhancement facts was merely allowed, rather than
        required, the trial court’s decision to sustain the demurrer
        would have been within its range of discretion. The Supreme
        Court would have lacked mandamus jurisdiction to address the
        matter, and to issue a decision reversing the trial court’s
        order sustaining the demurrer.</p>
        <p>In sum, <em>Reinke</em> and <em>Upton</em> addressed the
        exact same question—are enhancement facts “material elements”
        that must be alleged by indictment (or by information followed
        by a preliminary hearing)? <em>Reinke</em> says no, but
        <em>Upton</em>, despite its mischaracterization of the trial
        court’s order, says yes. Thus, the court answered the same
        question in polar opposite ways.</p>
        <p>The parties in <em>Reinke</em> did not address <em>Upton</em>
        in their briefing. Likewise, the <em>Reinke</em> court did not
        address <em>Upton</em> in its decision. This necessarily means
        that <em>Reinke</em> is not stare decisis on the question of
        whether <em>Reinke</em> should be reconsidered in light of
        <em>Upton</em> and in favor of holding that enhancement facts
        must be pled in the indictment (or in an information followed by
        preliminary hearing). <em>See</em> <a

        <h2><strong>§ 1-7.6. Specific Attacks—Double
        Counting.</strong></h2>
        <p>In two circumstances, certain sentencing schemes could be
        construed as permitting the use of the same set of facts to
        aggravate a defendant’s sentence twice for the same crime. Such
        a construction is ripe for constitutional challenge. The two
        circumstances are:</p>
        <p>1. Using the facts first to increase the crime
        classification, and then using the same facts to increase the
        crime’s subclassification under the guidelines. For example,
        burglary may be increased from second- to first-degree in any of
        four ways: (i) by proving that the defendant burglarized a
        dwelling, (ii) by proving that the defendant burglarized a mere
        building while armed with a deadly weapon, (iii) by proving that
        the defendant burglarized a mere building and caused or
        attempted to cause physical injury, or (iv) by proving that the
        defendant burglarized a mere building but used or threatened to
        use a dangerous weapon. ORS 164.225(1). First-degree burglary is
        increased from seriousness level 7 to 9 by proving that the
        defendant was armed with a deadly weapon or caused or threatened
        physical injury. OAR 213-018-0025(1). If a defendant burglarized
        a mere building while armed with a pistol, he would be convicted
        of first-degree rather than second-degree burglary. ORS
        164.225(1)(a). The state then could argue that the guidelines
        authorize using the defendant’s possession of the same pistol to
        enhance punishment for the same crime a second time, by
        increasing his crime’s subclassification from seriousness level
        7 to level 9. OAR 213-018-0025(1)(a). <em>See also</em> <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Minter&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=3172456014458146109&amp;scilh=0">State
        v. Minter</a>, 146 Or App 643, 934 P2d 585 (1997).</p>
        <p>2. Using the facts first to increase the crime
        classification, and then using the same facts to increase the
        defendant’s criminal-history score. <em>See</em> Chapter 3. An
        example of this is felony driving under the influence of
        intoxicants (DUII). A defendant’s first two DUII convictions
        within the previous 10-year period are misdemeanors; subsequent
        convictions within that period are felonies. ORS 813.011.
        Proving two or more prior DUIIs within the 10-year period
        increases the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony. The state
        then will argue that the guidelines authorize using the prior
        DUIIs to enhance punishment a second time for the same crime, by
        increasing the defendant’s criminal-history score.</p>
        <p>In each of these situations, the double use of the same facts
        to increase a defendant’s punishment twice for the same crime is
        grounds for a double jeopardy challenge. <a

        den</em>, 336 Or 422 (2004), the Court of Appeals rejected the
        double-jeopardy argument in the second of the circumstances
        described above. The court held that the felony DUII statutory
        scheme “unambiguously” authorizes basing a defendant’s
        criminal-history score on the same prior DUII convictions that
        were used as predicates to prove the current felony DUII charge,
        and rejected the claim that such double use violates double
        jeopardy. 190 Or App at 538. But arguably the statutory scheme
        in fact prohibits double use. This is because the prior DUIIs
        used to prove the felony element of the current felony DUII
        charge by necessity stem from the same criminal episode as the
        current charge. As explained in Chapter 3, crimes stemming from
        the same criminal episode may not be used to increase one
        another’s criminal history scores.</p>
        <p>Because the prior DUIIs are elements of the felony DUII
        charge, at least arguably the priors stem from the same criminal
        episode as the current DUII charge. This establishes that the
        statutory scheme at best is ambiguous about whether it prohibits
        or requires double use of the priors. Because the scheme at best
        is ambiguous, it does not make “crystal clear” that it requires
        double use. Therefore, construing and applying the scheme to
        achieve double use violates double jeopardy. <em>See</em> <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Missouri+v.+Hunter&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,38&amp;case=7184672996136280692&amp;scilh=0">Missouri

        (1983) (double use under statutory scheme is double jeopardy
        unless the legislature has “made its intent” to require double
        use “crystal clear”). <em>McCoin</em>’s contrary <em>dicta</em>,
        that “double jeopardy precludes the multiple use of the same
        facts to prove an element of the current offense and to enhance
        the defendant’s sentence for that offense only if the
        legislature intended to prohibit such double usage,” 190 Or App
        at 540, is erroneous, for it states the polar opposite of the
        double jeopardy principle from <em>Hunter</em>.</p>
        <p>Finally, even if the McCoin court was right about the felony
        DUII statutory scheme, that decision does not necessarily defeat
        the other double-jeopardy-based attack summarized above,
        involving first degree burglary. Moreover, <em>McCoin</em> does
        not at all address the due process principle at all, 190 Or App
        at 534 n 3, so that issue is ripe for litigation in both
        scenarios.</p>

        v. Deck</a>, 84 Or App 725, 735 P2d 637 (1987) (<em>in

        hearsay rules applied in sentencing hearings under
        <em>former</em> ORS 137.090 (1987 ed.). The 1989 Legislature
        amended the statute to overturn the court’s decision. But in a
        specially concurring opinion in <em>Deck</em>, Judge Warden
        disagreed with the court’s holding about the former statute, but

        <p>As amended, ORS 137.090 appears to codify Judge Warden’s view

        phrase “trustworthy and reliable” seemingly is a codification of

        <p>Apart from attacking priors on the ground that they were
        unconstitutionally obtained, the recidivist schemes typically
        allow bench trials using the preponderance standard, rather than
        jury trials using the reasonable doubt standard, on the
        existence of priors that would be used to aggravate sentences.
        <em>E.g</em>., ORS 137.079(5); OAR 213-004-0013. In cases where
        the defendant neither waived jury nor admitted to the existence

        rule states: “Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any
        fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the
        prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and
        proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 US at 490 (emphasis
        added). The emphasized text expressly states a prior-conviction
        exception that purports to exempt from the <em>Apprendi</em>
        rule the finding of prior convictions that recidivist schemes
        would use as predicates to enhance punishment. Consequently, the
        exception would allow trial courts, even without a jury waiver,
        to find the existence of prior convictions, and to do so while
        using only the preponderance standard. But for the following
        reasons, the prior-conviction exception is subject to federal
        constitutional attack.</p>

        Convictions—Characteristics.</strong></h3>
        <p>Regardless of the validity of the <em>Apprendi</em> rule’s
        prior-conviction exception, the exception has an exception.</p>
        <p>Some recidivist schemes allow use of prior convictions, and
        even juvenile adjudications, as predicates only if the state
        proves those priors have specified characteristics. The
        <em>Apprendi</em> rule applies to proof of those
        characteristics. <em>See</em> <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1569729417920761849&amp;q=544+US+13&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Shepard

        characteristics of prior conviction that must be proved in order
        to use prior to aggravate punishment for current crime, and
        Sixth Amendment jury trial principles limit proof to court
        documents from the prior proceedings such as the transcript, the
        charging instrument, and the plea petition).</p>
        <p><a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7370112933527027740&amp;q=342+Or+711&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State
        v. Bray</a>, 342 Or 711, 724, 168 P3d 983 (2007) provides an
        example. There, the trial court relied on a non-juried finding
        of Aggravating Factor D, persistent involvement in similar
        offenses, to impose a departure. The finding was grounded on the
        defendant’s record of prior convictions. But the factor could be
        used only if the priors had certain
        characteristics—specifically, that the priors, in juxtaposition
        to the defendant’s current crimes, reflected “persistent
        involvement in similar offenses.” The finding of that
        characteristic was non-juried, so the trial court’s use of
        Factor D to impose an aggravated departure violated the
        <em>Apprendi</em> rule.</p>
        <p>Thus, Aggravating Factor D is a sentencing law that contains
        a recidivist system that requires proof of predicates’
        characteristics, which are subject to the <em>Apprendi</em>
        rule. Oregon has several other sentencing laws that contain
        recidivist systems that, at least arguably, require proof of
        predicates’ characteristics. These other laws include:</p>

        Findings.</strong></h2>
        <p>Oregon has several sentencing schemes that aggravate
        punishment in the form of sentence enhancements or multiple
        convictions, based on findings that certain convictions were
        committed in “separate criminal episodes” from the crime to
        which the aggravation scheme would apply. Crimes stem from
        separate episodes if they were not committed during the phrase
        “same criminal episode”—a phrase which is synonymous with the
        phrase “same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.”

        <p>It should be noted that the joinder of counts and indictments
        theory, found at ORS 132.560(1)(b)(B), applies to crimes that
        stem from the same criminal episode. It is a mandatory joinder
        theory, because if the crimes are not joined, trial on some of
        the counts may create a former jeopardy bar to a subsequent
        trial on any of the other counts. <em>See</em> ORS 131.515(2).
        In <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18118992523436245909&amp;q=265+Or+App+30&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State
        v. Tooley</a>, 265 Or App 30, 333 P3d 348, rev den, 356 Or 575
        (2014), the Court of Appeals applied this joinder theory, and
        announced a same-criminal-episode concept more expansively than
        ever before seen.</p>
        <p>The case involved an aggravated murder prosecution under the
        theory that the defendant committed two murders “in the same
        criminal episode.” <em>See Tooley</em>, 265 Or App at 31. The
        two killings took place about 12 hours apart. Preexisting case
        law, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Knight</em>, typically holds that crimes
        having that sort of temporal separation stem from separate
        episodes. The defendant sought judgment of acquittal of the
        “aggravated” element. He argued “that his objective, to
        ‘advanc[e] his criminal career,’ was too broad,’ ‘distant,’ and
        abstract—not discrete enough—to be considered singular.
        Defendant argue[d], additionally, that the gap in time between
        the murders forecloses the conclusion that his conduct was
        ‘continuous and uninterrupted.’” <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18118992523436245909&amp;q=265+Or+App+30&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">Id</a>.
        at 38.</p>
        <p>The court rejected these arguments. The court instead favored
        the state’s theory, which urged the jury to “find that defendant
        spent the time in between the killings engaged in conduct that
        he had calculated was necessary to successfully complete, and
        escape culpability for, the second killing and thereby
        accomplish his overall objective.” <em>Id.</em> at 44.</p>
        <p>Although the court’s ruling disfavored defendant Tooley, the
        court’s embracement of the state’s theory would support similar
        defense arguments in favor of same-episode findings in cases
        where such findings would preclude using sentence-enhancement
        schemes—usually recidivist schemes—that apply only when crimes
        stem from separate criminal episodes.</p>
        <p>Further regarding the joinder of counts and indictments, the
        theories found at ORS 132.560(1)(b)(A) and (C), apply to crimes
        that do not stem from the same criminal episode, so apply to
        crimes that stem from separate episodes. Because former jeopardy
        principles to not apply to these joinder theories, these are
        permissive joinder theories.</p>

        (2017), the defendant demurred to a multiple-count indictment on
        the ground that it failed to state allegations demonstrating the
        authority to join the counts. In both its original and
        reconsideration opinions, the Court of Appeals agreed that
        multiple-count charging instruments must state such allegations,
        so reversed the trial court’s denial of the defendant’s
        demurrer.</p>
        <p>More recently, in the separate case of <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11652570505987944204&amp;q=364+Or+105&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State
        v. Warren</a>, 364 Or 105, 430 P3d 1036 (2018), the Supreme
        Court endorsed the <em>Poston</em> court’s decision. The
        <em>Warren</em> court held: “Based on the text and context of
        the joinder statute, ORS 132.560, and in keeping with our prior
        cases, we hold that an indictment that charges more than one
        offense must allege the basis for joining the charges.” 364 Or
        at 133 (emphasis added). But the court further held, “[E]ven
        assuming that the indictment in this case failed to satisfy that
        requirement, we hold that any error in the indictment in this
        case did not affect defendant’s substantial rights.”
        <em>Id</em>. Therefore, charging errors of this sort are subject
        to harmless-error analyses.</p>
        <p>Thus, when an indictment joins counts, or when the state
        moves to join indictments, the indictment must allege one or
        more of the ORS 132.5601)(b)’s joinder-of-counts theories. But
        if the indictment pleads that the crimes stemmed from the same
        episode, that allegation is not binding on the sentencing court
        (unless equitable or judicial estoppel requires adhering to the
        language). <em>See</em> <a

        v. Boyd</a><em>,</em> 271 Or 558, 565-66, 533 P2d 795
        (1975).</p>
        <p>To reflect the “judicial interpretation” of the phrase,
        <em>Nefstad</em>, 309 Or at 540, the definitional instruction
        should state the converse of the definition of the phrase “same
        criminal episode.” An appropriate definition should state along
        the lines of:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The phrase “separate criminal episode” means crimes that (i)
        are not so closely linked in time, place, and circumstance that
        a complete account of one charge may not be related without
        relating details of the other charge; (ii) are not directed
        toward the same criminal objective; and (iii) do not involve the
        possession of multiple pieces of contraband, even if of
        different types, at the same place and time.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But the defense is free to move for judgment of acquittal on
        the separate-episode allegation. If case law supports the
        separate-episode allegation, the trial court likely will deny
        the defense motion. But the court still must give the special
        verdict instruction and the definitional instruction. The court
        may not refuse to do so on the ground that controlling case law
        establishes that the convictions stem from separate episodes,
        for that would constitute an impermissible, directed verdict on
        the allegation. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <a

        v. Boots</a>, 315 Or 572, 593, 848 P2d 76 (1993).</p>
        <p>Moreover, even if well settled case law supports the
        prosecution’s argument for a “Yes” answer to the special verdict
        instruction, “’the jury has the power to bring in a verdict in
        the teeth of both the law and the facts.’” <a

        65 L Ed 185 (1920) (Holmes, J.)). So despite the case law, the
        jury would be free to return a verdict of “No.” Moreover, double
        jeopardy would prohibit the prosecution from appealing a “No”
        answer. <a

        <p>Thus, case law adverse to the defendant does not control the

        that notwithstanding RPC 3.3(a)(2), defense counsel is free to

        dictate a “Yes” answer, defense counsel is free to argue to the

        <h3><strong>§ 1-7.9.1. Specific Attacks—Separate Criminal
        Episode Findings for Application of “Non-Traditional” Recidivist
        Schemes.</strong></h3>
        <p>In <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Witte+v.+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=5421751169894487412&amp;scilh=0">Witte
        v. United States</a>, one of the defendant’s prior convictions,
        which he incurred before committing his current crime of
        conviction, was used to enhance his punishment for his current
        conviction. He challenged that enhancement, by arguing that
        using his prior conviction in this manner punished him a second
        time for his prior conviction, in violation of his rights
        against double jeopardy. The Court rejected that argument.
        Relying on the recidivist theory, the Court explained, “[A]
        crime committed by an offender with a prior
        conviction”—<em>i.e.</em>, an incorrigible offender, because his
        prior conviction failed to deter his new criminal conduct—“‘is
        considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive
        one.’” 515 US at 403 (quoting <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10229866156480998197&amp;q=334+US+728&amp;h">Gryger</a>,
        334 US at 732).</p>
        <p><em>Witte</em> thus held that the defendant was not punished
        a second time for his prior conviction. Instead, his punishment
        for his current crime of conviction was being enhanced because,
        as evidenced by the fact he reoffended after incurring his prior
        conviction, his prior had no specific deterrent effect on him.
        This lack of specific deterrent effect established him as
        incorrigible, so deserving of enhanced punishment relative to,
        for example, a first-time offender.</p>
        <p>Recidivist schemes such as that at issue in <em>Witte</em>,
        which use as predicates prior convictions, and even juvenile
        adjudications, incurred before the defendant’s commission of his
        current crime are “traditional” recidivist schemes. Oregon has a
        handful of traditional schemes. They include:</p>
        <p>• ORS 137.635;</p>
        <p>• The second time Class A felony sex offender statute, ORS
        137.725;</p>
        <p>• The felony DUII statutes, ORS 813.010(5); ORS 813.011;
        and</p>
        <p>• The firearm-minimum statute. ORS 161.610(4)(b) and (c).</p>
        <p>But Oregon has many more “non-traditional” recidivist
        schemes. These non-traditional schemes also use as predicates
        current crimes of conviction incurred to enhance punishment for
        other current crimes of conviction. These non-traditional
        schemes include:</p>
        <p>• Guidelines criminal-history scoring (<em>i.e.</em>,
        “reconstituting” criminal history), OAR 213-004-0006;</p>
        <p>• Major felony sex offender, ORS 137.690;</p>
        <p>• Repeat property offender, ORS 137.717;</p>
        <p>• Repeat felony sex offender, ORS 137.719;</p>
        <p>• Repeat drug-crime offender, ORS 475.934;</p>
        <p>• Separate convictions for crimes that otherwise would merge.
        ORS 161.067.</p>
        <p>• Repeat methamphetamine offender, ORS 475.935;</p>
        <p>• Dangerous offender (in Class B and C felony cases), ORS
        161.725(1)(b) and (c); and</p>
        <p>• Guidelines consecutive-sentence limitations (shift-to-I,
        200%, 400% rules). OAR 213-012-0020.</p>

        <p>Of major significance, the incorrigibility concept—failure of
        specific deterrence—which is used in traditional recidivist
        schemes is inapplicable in non-traditional schemes. The prior
        conviction could not possibly have deterred the defendant from
        committing the subsequent crime, because the defendant will have
        committed the “subsequent” crime before incurring the “prior
        conviction.”</p>
        <p>PRACTICE TIP: The incorrigibility concept, which saved the
        traditional recidivist scheme at issue in <em>Witte</em> from a
        double jeopardy attack, plays no role in non-traditional
        recidivist schemes. Because of that, defense counsel should rely
        on <em>Witte</em>, and <em>Gryger v. Burke</em>, to argue that
        non-traditional schemes’ use of current crimes as predicates
        violates double jeopardy. Counsel also should rely on <em>Alessi
        v. Quinlan</em> and <em>State v. Howe</em> to argue that
        non-traditional schemes’ use of current crimes as predicates is
        irrational, so violates substantive due process.</p>
        <p>Defendant counsel also should be aware of <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3667663101840199273&amp;q=210+Or+">State
        v. Rhoades</a>, 210 Or App 280, 149 P3d 1259 (2006). There, the
        defendant was sentenced under one of the state’s non-traditional
        recidivist schemes, the repeat felony sex offender law. ORS
        137.719. That law establishes life without parole (“true life”)
        for persons convicted of a felony sex crime, with the predicates
        being the defendant having been sentenced at least two times
        before for felony sex crimes (so a type of “three strikes” law).
        The defendant had two such predicates, but they were for crimes
        committed “in a single course of criminal conduct with the same
        victim, within a short time frame, and within a limited
        geographical area.” <em>Rhoades</em>, 210 Or App at 288. The
        court exercised its authority to create nonenumerated mitigating
        factors, to treat the rather singular nature of the predicates
        as “a substantial and compelling reason to depart from the
        presumptive life sentence,” and to impose a mitigated (downward)
        departure of 60 months. <em>Id</em>. at 282, 288. The Court of
        Appeals upheld that factor, stating: “[T]he particular
        circumstances here may be considered mitigating circumstances in
        determining if there are substantial and compelling reasons to
        depart from the presumptive life sentence.” <em>Id</em>. at
        289.</p>
        <p>PRACTICE TIP: Under ORS 137.719(3)(a), “[s]entences for two
        or more convictions that are imposed in the same sentencing
        proceeding are considered to be one sentence[.]” Defendant
        Rhoades had been sentenced in separate criminal proceedings
        twice before, for felony sex offenses. But the crimes were of
        such a nature that they could have been joined in a single
        proceeding. <em>See</em> ORS 132.560 (authorizing joinder of
        counts). Had they been joined, ORS 137.719(3)(a) would have
        prohibited application of the presumptive sentence of “true
        life.” This created the “particular circumstances” on which the
        Court of Appeals relied, to uphold the trial court’s
        nonenumerated mitigating factor. When possible in cases
        involving non-traditional recidivist schemes, defense counsel
        should rely on the nonenumerated factor from <em>Rhoades</em> to
        try to mitigate punishment.</p>

        v. Savastano</a>, 354 Or 64, 309 P3d 1083 (2013), the Supreme
        Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision, by overruling its
        by then 30-year-old decision in <a
        href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14678438841309438881&amp;q=295+Or+367&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48">State
        v. Freeland</a>, 295 Or 367, 375, 667 P2d 509 (1983), which held
        that under the equal privileges and immunities clause of Article
        I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution, the prosecution must
        adhere to a “coherent, systematic policy” (<em>i.e.</em>,
        legitimate criteria consistently applied) in making
        discretionary decisions.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court explained that to prevail on an Article I,
        section 20 claim, a defendant must initially show that the
        government in fact denied the individual defendant an equal
        privilege or immunity afforded other, similarly situated
        citizens. An executive agency’s or official’s decision will
        comply with Article I, section 20 so long as no discriminatory
        practice or illegitimate motive is shown, and the use of
        discretion has a defensible explanation in the individual case.
        The decision will be “defensible” when there is a rational
        explanation for the differential treatment that is reasonably
        related to the agency’s or official’s task, or to the person’s
        individual situation. The court further acknowledged that
        statutes or policies providing consistent guidelines for
        charging decisions may be useful in guiding prosecutorial
        discretion and limiting the potential for treating similarly
        situated individuals differently. But the court concluded that
        the failure to adopt or to adhere to such policies did not
        violate Article I, section 20.</p>

        the defendant claimed that the prosecutor had treated her
        arbitrarily when he aggregated numerous theft transactions month
        by month. In rejecting the defendant’s section 20 claim, the
        Supreme Court held that the prosecutor’s explanation, that he
        had aggregated the theft transactions for purposes of jury
        clarity, was reasonable and permissible, and satisfied the
        requirements of Article I, section 20.</p>

        <p>If a defendant’s constitutional speedy trial right is
        violated during the sentencing component of his prosecution, the
        remedy is dismissal of the sentencing component. In effect, this
        dismissal would result in the defendant incurring a sentence of
        discharge (discussed in Chapter 4). <em>See also</em> <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=496+F2d+190+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=6922017712383515899&amp;scilh=0">Juarez-Casares</a>,

        sentencing right “is to vacate the sentence and release the

        <p>But defense counsel must recognize that a defendant may face
        a sentencing phase trial that is bifurcated from the trial phase
        (<em>i.e.</em>, his trial on the underlying crimes and,
        generally, on offense-specific enhancement facts, ORS 136.770).
        The sentencing trial would address only any offender-specific
        enhancement facts, ORS 136.773, and offense-specific enhancement
        facts that were deferred to the sentencing phase under ORS
        136.770(1)(a) and (4). Or in a case that another court has
        remanded for resentencing, under ORS 136.790 and 136.792, the

        facts discussed in Section 1-7.2.3.</p>
        <p>But no matter the procedural posture of the sentencing trial,
        it is part of the defendant’s trial. As such, ORS 135.747’s
        statutory speedy trial requirements arguably apply to the
        sentencing component. Because a statutory dismissal does not
        require a demonstration of prejudice, as is required for a
        constitutional dismissal, in cases of prosecution-caused
        unreasonable delays in sentencing trials, defense counsel should
        not hesitate to move to dismiss on statutory grounds as well as,
        when appropriate, constitutional grounds.</p>

        <h2><strong>§ 1-7.12. Specific Attacks—Special State
        Constitutional Provisions.</strong></h2>
        <p>The Oregon Constitution’s Bill of Rights has two sections
        that restrict trial court sentencing authority. Ordinarily
        defendants use these sections in an effort to avoid application
        of the state’s various, mandatory sentencing laws. But the Bill
        of Rights sections may be used as a means to avoid application
        of any of the state’s sentencing laws, mandatory or
        otherwise.</p>
        <p>The first of the Bill of Rights sections (previously
        discussed in Section 1-1.1), states: “Laws for the punishment of
        crime shall be founded on these principles: protection of
        society, personal responsibility, and accountability for one’s
        actions and reformation.” Or Const, Art I, § 15. In <a

        v. Kinkel</a>, the court confronted the claim that the
        effectively “true-life” sentence—a “string” of consecutive,
        mandatory sentences totaling about 112 years that the trial
        court imposed on a defendant who was 15-years-old and suffered
        from multiple, untreated or improperly treated mental illnesses
        when he committed his crimes but who was demonstrably amenable
        to rehabilitation if he received proper treatment—was
        unconstitutional under the principles that section 15
        enumerates. The court rejected the claim, stating: “To the
        extent that the four criteria [of Article I, section 15] can be
        applied on the level of individualized sentencing, their
        particular significance must vary depending on the circumstances
        of the crime or crimes being sentenced.” <a

        <p>The second of the Bill of Rights sections states in pertinent
        part: “Cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted, but
        all penalties shall be proportioned to the offense.” Or Const,
        Art I, ß 16. This provision lends itself to three types of
        challenges, the first of which parallels an Eighth
        Amendment-type challenge, which defendants base on national and
        even international comparisons of sentences for specific
        criminal behavior to determine whether a jurisdiction’s sentence
        for that crime is so far beyond the norm that imposing it would
        be constitutionally impermissible. <em>See, e.g.</em> <a

        <p>In the context of an Article I, section 16 challenge, a

        of Appeals said that in determining whether application of a
        sentence “is so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the
        moral sense of all reasonable persons,” Oregon courts use the
        three-part Eighth Amendment test stated in <a

        Under that test, the court considers: “(1) the gravity of the
        offense and the harshness of the penalty; (2) the sentences
        imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (3) the
        sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other
        jurisdictions.” <em>Thorp</em>, 166 Or App at 571. The
        <em>Thorp</em> court further indicated that within that
        three-part test, the court considers the defendant’s background,
        including his criminal history (if any). <em>See Id</em>. at
        578.</p>
        <p>The analysis for whether a penalty violates the “cruel and
        unusual” clause is not dependent on historical antecedents, such
        as whether cutting off a hand for theft was cruel and unusual
        punishment in 1776. Because morality and ethics are not static,
        and instead evolve through time, the federal clause looks to
        “the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a

        <p>The foundation of the <em>Bartol</em> court’s decision is the
        2019 Legislature’s Senate Bill 1013 (enrolled as Oregon Laws
        2019, chapter 635). That bill severely restricted the scope of
        the state’s capital punishment scheme. “[A]lthough the
        legislature did not make SB 1013 retroactive as to sentences
        imposed before its effective date, maintaining defendant’s death
        sentence would violate Article I, section 16. Therefore, we * *
        * reverse his death sentence and remand the case for
        resentencing.” <em>Bartol,</em> 368 Or at 600.</p>
        <p>In so holding, the court effectively made SB 1013 retroactive
        to defendant Bartol’s sentence imposed before the bill’s
        effective date. The court explained:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“[T]he enactment of the bill itself reflects a judgment that
        conduct that was previously classified as ‘aggravated murder’
        does not fall within the narrow category of conduct that can be
        punished by death, as opposed to lesser sentences, including
        life imprisonment. Consequently, maintaining defendant’s death
        sentence in this case would violate two special proportionality
        requirements that, under Article I, section 16, apply to the
        death penalty: [1] the requirement that the death penalty be
        limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the
        most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the
        most deserving of execution, and [2] the requirement that there
        be a fundamental, moral distinction between crimes that are
        punishable by death and those that are not. Maintaining his
        death sentence would allow the execution of a person for conduct
        that the legislature has determined no longer justifies that
        unique and ultimate punishment, and it would allow the execution
        of a person for conduct that the legislature has determined is
        no more culpable than conduct that should not result in death.
        Therefore, in light of the legislature’s enactment of SB 1013,
        we conclude that defendant’s sentence violates Article I,
        section 16.”</p>

        <p>Interestingly, the <em>Bartol</em> decision could be used in

        <p>The <em>Rodriguez/Buck</em> court established the third means
        for bringing a section 16 challenge. The court explained that to
        decide section 16 proportionality claims, the court “examines
        [i] the relationship between the severity of the penalty and the
        gravity of the offense, including consideration of the
        particular conduct of the defendant that constituted the
        offense. We also consider [ii] the penalties imposed for other
        crimes and [iii] the defendant’s criminal history.”
        <em>Rodriguez/Buck</em>, 347 Or at 79 (emphasis added).</p>
        <p>Addressing the first consideration, the court explained that
        both defendants’ convictions were based on facts that were “at
        the outer edge of” the type of conduct required for first-degree
        sexual abuse convictions. <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=347+Or+46&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=15869527206720165540&amp;scilh=0">Id.</a>
        at 75. Regarding the third consideration, neither defendant had
        any criminal history. <em>Id</em>. at 73-78.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most significant feature of the court’s
        opinion is found in the phrase emphasized above, “for other
        crimes.” For the first time, the court did not base a favorable
        proportionality decision strictly on a “vertical” comparison of
        sentences. Instead, the court also based its decisions on a type
        of “horizontal” comparison, by considering the Measure 11
        minimum for first-degree sexual abuse against “the penalties
        imposed for other crimes that have similar characteristics to
        the crime at issue”; specifically, the second-degree versions of
        rape, sodomy, and sexual abuse. <em>Id.</em> at 75. The court
        explained:</p>
        <p>“[N]othing in the concept of proportionality in criminal
        sentencing suggests that the only ‘proportion’ that should be
        considered is the relationship between the crime for which the
        defendant was convicted and the punishment for that
        crime. Indeed, a standard that considers the offense and the
        penalty at issue in the context of related offenses and
        penalties provides a closer connection to the manner in which
        the substantive criminal laws and the sentencing statutes work
        together—and to what would, or would not, ‘shock the moral
        sense’ of reasonable people—than the purely abstract comparison
        of any single offense and the penalty for that offense.”</p>
        <p><em>Id.</em> at 64-65.</p>
        <p>However, this part of the analysis does not involve comparing
        aggregate sentences—consecutive sentences for multiple
        convictions—with the sentence for a single crime. Thus, the
        court rejected the defendant’s claim, which he based on a
        comparison of his consecutive 119-month “sentence for 10 counts
        of first-degree encouraging child sex abuse to the [100-month]
        sentence for [the] single related crime” of first-degree rape.

        recons</em>, 236 Or App 240, 236 P3d 755 (2010), the defendant
        brought a proportionality claim against the 25-year mandatory
        minimum for a sexual offense committed against a child,
        specified by ORS 137.700(2)(b)(D)-(F). Among other things, the
        defendant based his claim on the fact that his mandatory minimum
        for a non-homicide offense was equal to the mandatory minimum
        for murder. <em>See</em> ORS 137.700(2)(a)(A).</p>
        <p>In its original opinion, the Court of Appeals rejected that
        claim on the ground that it was impermissibly based on a
        “horizontal” comparison. After the Supreme Court held in <a
        href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=347+Or+46&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,38&amp;case=15869527206720165540&amp;scilh=0">Rodriguez/Buck</a>
        that such comparisons are permissible, the Court of Appeals
        concluded that it must reconsider its original decision. <em>See
        Alwinger,</em> 236 Or App at 242. The court reaffirmed that
        decision on the ground that although the minimum terms for
        murder and certain child-sex offenses might be equal, unlike the
        child-sex offenses, murder carries a mandatory indeterminate
        term of life, which the Board of Parole &amp; Post-Prison
        Supervision might not set aside after the murderer completes his
        25-year minimum. <em>See Id.</em> at 246.</p>
        <p>Alwinger thus establishes that how a defendant will be
        treated later, while he is in prison serving his sentence, may
        be considered in a proportionality analysis. This provides the
        possibility of relying on the expected nature of a defendant’s
        imprisonment as the basis for a renewed proportionality claim
        against the 25-year mandatory minimum for certain child sex
        offenses.</p>
        <p>Publications such as Ethan Hoffman &amp; John McCoy,
        <em>Concrete Mama: Prison Profiles from Walla Walla</em> (1986),
        provide insight into the likely nature of how pedophiles will be
        treated in prison. They regularly are victims of extortion. For
        example, fellow inmates may require them to pay “taxes” just to
        survive in general population in relative safety. Not
        infrequently, fellow inmates will assault, and even sexually
        assault, pedophiles. Sometimes pedophiles will feel compelled to
        “marry” fellow inmates who will protect them from other inmates.
        Although that requires a pedophile to become his fellow inmate’s
        “herm” (her + him), the idea is that it is better to be sexually
        assaulted by one inmate, rather than by several. To avoid the
        deplorable treatment that pedophiles receive at the hands of
        fellow inmates, pedophiles often check into protective custody
        where they live in mind-crushing isolation. Not surprisingly,
        pedophiles have high rates of suicide. Even if they do survive
        their time in prison, they leave broken beyond repair, so have
        little or no life left anyway.</p>
        <p>A record made in reliance on the Court of Appeals
        reconsideration opinion in <em>Alwinger</em>, documenting how a
        pedophile will be treated while in prison, could persuade the
        courts that notwithstanding the indeterminate life sentence that
        accompanies a 25-year minimum for murder, a child-sex offender’s
        25-year sentence is far worse than a murder sentence. Indeed,
        owing to the high suicide rate among pedophiles, it could be
        argued that the treatment that pedophiles endure while in prison
        establishes that a 25-year mandatory minimum is a “fate worse
        than death.” If successful, this argument would establish that
        the sentence for the non-homicide crime actually is worse than a
        homicide crime.</p>
        <p>Thus, creating a record that demonstrates the nature of
        imprisonment for murder offenders, as opposed to pedophiles,
        could serve as the basis for a renewed proportionality attack
        against the 25-year mandatory minimum for certain child-sex
        offenses.</p>

        v. Morales</a><em>,</em> 367 Or 222, 476 P3d 954 (2020), the
        Oregon Supreme Court stated the basic principles a trial court
        must apply, to determine whether the defendant is able to pay
        financial obligations, and, thus, whether the court may impose
        financial obligations on the defendant:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“[T]he ability to pay inquiry requires two steps: the court
        first determines whether the defendant ‘is or may be able to
        pay’ costs under ORS 161.665(4); if the answer is yes, then the
        court determines a reasonable amount to impose. If, however, the
        answer to the first question is ‘no’—that the defendant does not
        have the ability to pay—the inquiry ends, and the court is not
        permitted to impose costs. A trial court may not determine that
        a defendant has no ability to pay costs under ORS 161.665(4) and
        then, despite that finding, impose fees under ORS 161.665(1)
        based solely on security deposit funds <strong>that do not
        belong to the defendant</strong>.</p>
        <p>“As discussed, we need not decide whether funds deposited by
        a third party as security never may be used to satisfy a
        defendant’s obligations. When funds deposited by a third party
        nevertheless belong to a defendant, they may be used to satisfy
        the defendant’s financial obligations. Without the presumption
        that security funds belong to a defendant, however, funds paid
        by and belonging to a third party <strong>cannot be</strong> the
        sole basis for a finding that a defendant has the ‘ability to
        pay’ court-ordered costs.”</p>

        <p>Practitioners should be familiar with the limitations on the
        imposition of these other types of sanctions. For crimes
        committed before January 1, 2004 and for all hit-and-run cases,
        the main limitation is that a court must consider whether the
        defendant has a present and a future ability to pay before
        imposing any type of monetary payment. <em>E.g.</em>, <a

        <p>For other than hit-and-run convictions for crimes committed
        on or after January 1, 2004, the court is not required to
        consider a defendant’s ability to pay. Or Laws 2003, ch 670. For
        those cases, the law specifies in relevant part that the</p>
        <p>“court may delay the enforcement of the monetary sanctions,
        including restitution, only if the defendant alleges and
        establishes to the satisfaction of the court the defendant’s
        inability to pay the judgment in full at the time the judgment
        is entered. If the court finds that the defendant is unable to
        pay, the court may establish or allow an appropriate supervising
        authority to establish a payment schedule, taking into
        consideration the financial resources of the defendant and the
        burden that payment of restitution will impose, with due regard

        <p>When it determines whether a defendant has established that
        he “is unable to pay” restitution, a court must be mindful of
        Article I, section 19 of the Oregon Constitution, which
        precludes “imprisonment for debt, except in the case of fraud or
        absconding debtors.” The court also must be mindful of the

        debtors be afforded the same protections as civil judgment

        jury and the jury convicts the defendant of a crime, the trial
        court is not authorized to award restitution under ORS 137.106

        victim. The jury acquitted the defendant of the assault charge,
        but convicted him of the harassment charge. Notwithstanding the
        jury’s acquittal on the assault charge, the trial court imposed

        defendant’s conviction for harassment that the jury necessarily
        found that defendant delivered the punch that resulted in damage
        to the victim’s tooth bridge. The jury could have based its
        decision on the spitting evidence alone. Therefore, the trial

        v. Rieker</a>, 302 Or App 613, 461 P3d 1083 (2020), the trial
        court imposed restitution outside the 90-day limit without
        making a finding of good cause. Relying on Article I, section
        42(1)(d), of the Oregon Constitution, which states that a crime
        victim has “[t]he right to receive prompt restitution from the
        convicted criminal who caused the victim’s loss or injury,” the

        <blockquote>
        <p>“[T]he right of a victim to receive compensation is not
        ‘purely statutory’ because the statutory scheme itself does not
        create the right of a victim to receive prompt restitution.
        Thus, when a court is acting to remedy a victim’s constitutional
        right to restitution, * * * ORS 137.106 does not prevent a trial
        court from imposing restitution beyond the statutory deadline. *
        * * Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in
        declining to consider “good cause” because it had constitutional
        authority to remedy a violation of the victim’s rights and
        impose restitution beyond the 90-day deadline.”</p>

        <em>see</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, ORS 137.101 (compensatory fine);
        ORS 813.010(6)(d) (enhanced fine for “high blow” DUII

        form of punishment (the sentence) that may be imposed consequent
        to a conviction. ORS 137.010(7). In reversing a trial court’s
        imposition of a fine, whose amount the court based on non-juried
        findings, the United States Supreme Court explained:</p>
        <p>“In all such cases [in which the amount of a fine is
        calculated by reference to particular facts], requiring juries
        to find beyond a reasonable doubt facts that determine the
        fine’s maximum amount is necessary to implement
        <em>Apprendi</em>’s “animating principle”: the “preservation of
        the jury’s historic role as a bulwark between the State and the
        accused at the trial for an alleged offense.” [<a

        distinguished one form of punishment from another. Instead, our
        decisions broadly prohibit judicial factfinding that increases

        Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR), whose
        Article 15, paragraph 1 states: “If, subsequent to the
        commission of the offence, provision is made by law for the
        imposition of a lighter penalty, the offender shall benefit
        thereby.” For a time, it seemed possible that the ICCPR might
        require the resentencing of defendants who were sentenced for
        crimes, committed before the 1989 Legislature approved the
        Felony Sentencing Guidelines, would be entitled to shorter
        sentences under the Guidelines. But in 1992, when the United
        States Senate finally ratified the covenant, it attached
        numerous reservations to the ICCPR, <strong>including to its
        Article 15, paragraph 1</strong>. Kristina Ash, <a

        nullifies the paragraph’s application in the United States, so
        affirms domestic law that legislation that reduces sentences,
        but contains no retroactivity clause, applies prospectively
